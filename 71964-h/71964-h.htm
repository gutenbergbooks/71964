<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>The Landslide</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>Raising his head in a gesture of disdain that
was almost human, the horse walked stiff-legged
around a porcupine that lay in the center
of the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steering clear of needles, Flash?” said
his rider, laughing cheerfully. “Say, Roy,”
he called to his companion, who sat astride a
chestnut mustang, “is it true that porcupines
can shoot their quills?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bunk!” answered Roy Manley briefly.
“Pure bunk, Teddy. You don’t mean to say
you believed that, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, that’s a question,” Teddy
Manley replied, a veiled twinkle in his eyes.
“Some say one thing, some say another. Pop
Burns told me a porcupine shot him full of
quills from ten feet away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pop Burns!” Roy snorted. “He could
convince an Eskimo that ice was made of rock
candy. You ought to know Pop by this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two brothers pulled their horses to a
halt and gazed curiously at the small, quilled
animal. The boys were alike in build, both
being lean, wiry products of ranch life. Teddy
Manley, fifteen years old, one year younger
than Roy, had light hair and blue eyes, favoring
his mother, Mrs. Bardwell Manley, in these
respects. Roy took after his father in the
matter of eyes and hair—both of these being
brown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy ran his hand over the ears of Star, his
pony. From any other, this would have been
cause for immediate proceedings tending toward
the unseating of the rider, but now Star
whinnied affectionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell you what,” Roy declared. “Let’s
bring this sticker home with us and get Pop
to explain how it shoots its quills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good idea,” Teddy answered, grinning.
“You’re elected, Roy. How are you going to
carry it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph! Never thought of that,” the
brother demurred. “If we had something we
could wrap it up in—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or if we had a wagon,” Teddy went on.
He was deriving much amusement from Roy’s
serious attention to the problem at hand.
Quieter, and looking at life through graver eyes
than Teddy, Roy would frequently devote himself
to the solemn consideration of a question
which Teddy would dismiss with a light laugh.
Roy’s nature was drawn from his mother, who,
before her marriage to Bardwell Manley, had
been a schoolteacher in Denver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you tie him to Star’s tail?”
asked Teddy, his face a study in innocence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t I? A fine suggestion!” his
brother burst out. “Why don’t you carry him
under your arm? You’ve got a leather vest on—you
won’t get stuck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy assumed to consider this proposition.
He dismounted and walked toward the porcupine.
Bending over, he peered closely at the
curled-up animal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks as if he were dead,” the boy said
finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not dead,” Roy declared convincingly.
“You try to pat him on the head if you think
so. He just curls up so you’ll let him alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like a steam roller?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea, like a steam roller,” answered Roy,
with a grin. “If you think I’m going to ask
why, you’re mistaken. Go on, pick him up,
Teddy. He won’t hurt you. He likes children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why don’t you take a crack at him?”
the other boy demanded. The one year’s
difference in their ages was a touchy point with
Teddy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too busy. I have to hold your horse or
he’ll slide down the mountain side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two boys were returning from a ride
across the country. They had been investigating
some land that their father, who was the
owner of the X Bar X Ranch, was thinking of
purchasing for grazing ground. They had
stayed longer than they had intended, and,
wishing to reach home before night, had taken
a short cut over Mica Mountain. The riding
was not of the best, especially at this time of
year when the warm summer sun had melted
the snows on the peaks and the water, flowing
down, was loosening the top soil. But the
brothers were willing to chance a possible accident
for the sake of arriving home “in time
for grub.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry about Flash!” Teddy exclaimed.
“He could stand on the side of a
house. Well, what’s the news? Are we going
to take old Needleback home with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure! Wrap him in—” Roy stopped suddenly.
He tilted his head forward in a listening
attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thunder,” Teddy remarked. “I heard
it, too. Come on, let’s be on our way. Never
mind the porcupine.” He walked over to
Flash and rested his hand on the pommel of the
saddle. As he did so the rolling noise was
repeated, this time much louder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thunder nothing!” Roy cried. “There’s
not a cloud in the sky. That’s up the mountain
some place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, whatever it is, I don’t like the
sound of it!” came from Teddy, as he vaulted
into the saddle. “Makes my flesh creep. I’m
tired, I guess. We’ve been riding ever since
early morning. That’s the longest stretch I’ve
been on a horse since that night we chased the
rustlers all over creation. Baby, that was
<span class='it'>some</span> time! Wonder what happened to the
three men who got away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I suppose they left the country,” Roy
answered, as he guided his bronco down the
steep trail. “Birds like that don’t linger long
in one place, especially when they know that
place isn’t healthy for them. The four we put
in jail are there for a good stretch, I hope—though
that jail in Hawley isn’t any too
strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it! Well, if they escape, they
escape, that’s all. But they’d better not try
any more funny work around here. Dad’ll
salivate ’em. Jimminy! I wonder what that
noise was that we heard. It’s got me kind of
leery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rocks falling, most likely. Don’t know
what else it could be. I know it isn’t thunder.
Come on, get a wiggle on. Be dark soon.
Watch your step, this footing isn’t any too
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keeping firm hands on the reins, the two
ranch boys proceeded down the mountain side.
The ground was covered with a loose shale, and
the mountain on this side was nearly devoid of
trees. It would not do to urge the horses to
a faster gait than they naturally took, for a
fall here meant a nasty slide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear Nell and Ethel are going to stay at
the 8 X 8 most of this coming winter,” Roy
remarked casually, as he guided Star around
a large rock. He referred to two New York
girls with whom the brothers had become
acquainted some time before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say!” his brother returned, in
a bantering tone. “I suppose the news just
trickled out! You didn’t ask mother to ’phone
over to Mrs. Ball and find out, did you? Oh,
no! Well, let’s have it all. Why are they going
to stay all winter, Mr. Bones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw, dry up,” Roy said, laughing, albeit his
face was a trifle red. “Trying to kid me, aren’t
you? How’s Curly, Ted? Have you heard
from her lately?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I haven’t!” and Teddy in his turn became
flustered. “But I know why they are
going to stay all winter, even if you don’t.
Their folks went abroad. Mr. Carew had to
settle an estate with ramifications in Italy, and
Mr. and Mrs. Willis went with him and his
wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh-ho! Our little detective on the job!
Say, don’t try to kid me. After that you
haven’t got a word to say! Star, take it easy!
This pony must want to get home in a hurry.”
Roy steadied his grip on the reins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess he didn’t like that noise any more
than we did,” Teddy suggested. “These
horses know almost as much as we do, they’ve
been with us so long. It was sure tough when
the rustlers stole them, wasn’t it? Great to
have them back, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell a maverick it is! And we’re lucky
those rustlers—especially Froud—didn’t ride
’em to death. Checkered Shirt prevented
Froud from injuring them, I guess. Wonder
what became of him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t imagine. He turned out to be a
pretty decent sort of a hombre after all, didn’t
he? Well, I wish him luck. He certainly did
us a favor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy was referring to the leader of a gang
of rustlers who had turned friendly when the
brothers saved him from death and had in consequence
helped them recover their ponies,
which had been stolen by Gilly Froud to revenge
himself against Mr. Manley for his discharge
by the ranch owner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the brothers rode down the trail, Roy
frequently turned in his saddle and gazed up
the mountain. Finally Teddy asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the idea, Roy? Why the interested
stare? Expect to see a friend of yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not any. But I’m still curious about that
noise. Seems to have stopped, and I’d like to
know what it really was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought you said it was rocks falling down
the mountain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it probably was. But that doesn’t
prove anything. Suppose it was a landslide?
It might be, you know. And landslides aren’t
things you can fool with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A landslide on Mica Mountain? Forget it!
Never knew one to happen yet. Golly, look at
that buzzard! Wish I had a rifle along; bet I
could knock him for a loup.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy turned again in his saddle. Evidently he
had not heard Teddy’s remark about the bird
circling overhead, for he did not reply. Instead
he listened intently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, what’s the matter with you?” Teddy
demanded, as he watched his brother. “You
give me the willies. Why don’t you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy held up his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen!” he commanded. “Hear that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the boys’ ears came that same queer
rumbling noise. Now it did not decrease as it
had before, but grew louder and louder. The
brothers faced each other, paling beneath their
tan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a stone hit the ground with a crash
directly in front of Teddy’s horse. The
thunder increased in volume—it seemed almost
at their heels. Then another stone fell—and
another!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a flash, both boys turned. What they
saw caused their breath to stick in their throats
and their hearts to beat madly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole mountain side seemed to have
been torn loose. Huge boulders were tumbling
toward them. The few trees that dotted the
landscape were uprooted and toppled with
majestic force. The air was filled with flying
pieces of rock!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above all rose that sullen, deep-throated
roar like a giant in anger.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span><h1>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>A Missing Brother</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Ride!” Teddy yelled. “It’s a landslide!
Watch out for—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His words were drowned by a <span class='it'>bo-o-o-m!</span> that
seemed to shake the mountain to its very
base. Teddy wasted no more time in useless
explanations. Wisely he gave Flash his head
and let the bronco pick his own path down the
treacherous incline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As horse and rider catapulted toward level
ground, Teddy’s first thought was for his
brother. He turned swiftly in the saddle, and
his heart gave a leap when he saw that Roy had
disappeared. Frantically the boy peered
through the haze of dust which hung over the
landscape like a pall, but Roy was nowhere
to be seen. Teddy knew it would be hopeless
to yell, as he could never make himself heard
over the crashing roar of the landslide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a silent prayer for his brother’s safety,
the rider was forced to use all his skill to retain
his seat in the saddle. Lucky for him that
he had, as his father put it, “been born aboard
a bronc,” else he must surely have been flung
to the ground, to be seriously injured, if not
killed, by the rocks and trees that were sweeping
swiftly down the mountain side, almost at
his heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flash, his eyes white with fright, was leaping
for safety like some wild animal. Now and
then he would give a whinny of terror as a rock
landed at his side with a thud. The chances
were about even that the boy and his pony
would avoid the falling stones. Yet, as each
one hurtled by, it seemed certain that the next
must strike and send the horse and rider crashing
to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stick to it, Flash!” Teddy panted, drawing
his hand quickly over his eyes to clear them
of sweat. “Another five hundred feet and we’ll
be safe—the slide is slowing up! If I could
only see—this dust—if Roy is safe—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grinding noise to the rear of the boy was
gradually lessening, and the hurtling rocks
were becoming fewer in number. Still Teddy
knew he was by no means safe, as any moment
another slide might start and overtake him.
And a second slide, piled on top of the already
loosened earth, might completely overwhelm
him. He must ride, and ride hard, if he wished
to place himself out of danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flash’s trip down the mountain was one of
breath-taking escapes from destruction. Teddy
swayed with him as though he were a part of
the horse. Almost automatically, the boy would
know when the bronco was going to plant his
feet to avoid a sudden drop, and he would
brace himself for the shock. Then the pony
would slide and leap—slide and leap. On
Teddy’s part it was a marvel of horsemanship;
on Flash’s part it was a wonderful example of
animal intelligence. Frightened as he was, the
pony never once made a misstep, never once
gave way to his terror and dashed blindly forward.
Had he done so it would have meant
the end for Teddy Manley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment the young rancher bore little
resemblance to the young man registered as
“Theodore Havens Manley, Latin Scientific
Course,” on the records of the Hopper Boarding
School. His face was streaked with dust,
and perspiration had smudged it into a black
mask. His hat was gone—swept off by a swishing
branch—and his hair was in wild disorder.
His clothing was torn in several places by the
bushes he had dashed through. He was panting
fiercely, and his eyes were sharpened into
two points of blue light. From his lips came
words that were barely articulate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Flash—watch that rock! Stick to it,
old boy, stick to it—a little more—yow! That
was a close one! All right, baby, you’re not
hurt—take it easy now—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A leap—a swift, neck-jerking halt—slipping,
sliding, trying desperately for a foothold—another
leap—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a yell burst from Teddy’s lips.
Frantically he pulled on the reins, seeking
vainly to stop the pony almost in midair. The
boy’s face paled. In front of him, so close that
the horse’s forefeet seemed on the very edge,
yawned a deep gully!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flash! We’re done for! Ah-h—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second that remained to him Teddy
made his decision. It was impossible to stop,
the gully seemed to rush eagerly to meet them.
There was only one chance—that Flash could
clear it, could leap to the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy released the reins. He dug his heels
deep into the pony’s sides. And, with his heart
in his throat, the boy felt the horse rise beneath
him and sail through the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the mount and his rider were
silhouetted against the sky like a frantic picture
thrown on the silversheet. A moment—then
Teddy felt his very bones grind together in
the shock of that swift descent. Vaguely he
looked about him. Flash, trembling like a leaf,
was standing upon a broad plateau. They were
safe!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy nodded his head several times, slowly,
deliberately, as if to confirm his past thoughts.
Then he dismounted stiffly, and putting a hand
on either side of the pony’s head, he looked him
straight in the eyes. For a second—perhaps
two—he stood there, while Flash gradually
grew still and breathed easier. When he
whinnied softly, Teddy rubbed the pony’s ears
and stepped back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Finish!” the boy said. Then he laughed,
adding:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me, I’m going to join the aviation and have
you for a plane! Jimminy, what a jump! Let’s
see—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning, Teddy walked to the edge. The
dust of the landslide had almost settled, and he
saw plainly the other side of the gully. It was
a great deal higher than the land on which he
stood, which difference in elevation was the
only reason Flash had been able to make the
leap. No horse could have jumped that distance
on the level. Even with this drop to aid
him, it seemed almost impossible that Flash
had done it. Yet there he stood, looking at
his master with knowing eyes, and here Teddy
stood—safe!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where in thunder <span class='it'>am</span> I?” the boy exclaimed
suddenly. “I don’t remember seeing
this gully before. If I could get to the other
side again I could probably find my way home,
but there’s not a dog’s chance of ever leaping
back.” He looked down into the abyss and
shuddered. The thought of that tremendous
jump was unnerving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Teddy walked toward Flash, he felt a
wave of uneasiness pass over him, as though
an unpleasant thought were hiding in his brain
somewhere. His mind leaped forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where was his brother? What had happened
to him? Did he escape? They were both ahead
of the slide, surely he could not have fallen!
Star could bring him out of it—unless he was
struck by a rock!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy hunched his shoulders. He ran his
hand through his hair and discovered for the
first time that he had no hat on. Then he
looked about him, as if he expected to find the
hat lying under a bush. The hat—never mind
the hat! Roy was gone!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In silence and with a deep frown creasing
his forehead, Teddy remounted. Could it be
possible that his brother had come to this same
gully and, as he had, leaped with his horse to
the other side? Teddy cast his eye along the
opposite edge. Less than a quarter of a mile
away the lip of the gorge dipped down, so that
it was level with the plateau on which Flash
stood. The meaning of this struck Teddy like
a dash of cold water. This, then, was the only
place the leap could be made! If a pony tried
the jump where both sides were level, he would
hit the cliff with his hind feet, while his front
feet would paw desperately on the loose earth
of the plateau’s edge, seeking madly to draw
himself and his rider to safety, then with a
scream he would lose his hold—fall backward—turning
over and over—over and over—</p>

<p class='pindent'>A groan burst from Teddy’s lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It could not be! It must not be! Roy was
safe! He had turned to one side and had ridden
from under the landslide. Now he was looking
for Teddy, wondering what had happened, wondering
if Teddy had made it all right. Now he
was taking off his hat, rubbing back his hair
and muttering something about, “I’ll tell a
maverick that was some ruckus!” Certainly
he was safe, Teddy argued. Roy—good old
Roy—he’d come riding along any minute now
and yell across to his brother asking him if the
landslide didn’t remind him of the scene in
“The Fall of Pompeii.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Roy did not come riding along, and the
sun was casting long shadows as Teddy rode
slowly along the edge of the gorge. Somehow
he would have to find his way out of here. He
must reach home and send a party out to search
for Roy. No, Roy would be waiting for him
when he got there! Maybe he would arrive in
time to halt those who were about to start after
Teddy. If he hurried they might find Roy before
it was too late! No, no! Roy was home
already!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t go on like this,” the boy muttered,
bending low over the pony’s head. “The thing
to do is to find dad as quickly as I can and tell
him. He’ll know what to do. But I won’t let
mother know—not until we find Roy. Then Roy
can tell her. If I could only remember this
gully I might reach the ranch without riding all
over the landscape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hunched his shoulders again, as another
boy might straighten up, and thrust his chin
forward. Chirping to his mount, he increased
his pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sky above him had turned to a pale blue
that was almost white, while to the west, beyond
the mountains, a riot of color blazed. Teddy
threw his head back as a shrill, hoarse cry of a
circling buzzard tore the silence. Then the boy
raised in his stirrups and shook his fist fiercely
at the winged carrion-eater.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want here? There’s nothing
for you! Search! Go ahead and search, you
filthy buzzard! You won’t find anything, I
tell you! Roy is home—home! And he and I
will come out to-morrow and toss some lead
into you! Maybe you’ll like to try that for a
change of diet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strangely enough, the bird ceased his
ominous circling, and with another scream disappeared
over the rim of trees. Teddy sank
back into the saddle, his face somewhat red,
ashamed of his outburst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must be getting woozy,” he muttered.
“Yellin’ at a buzzard! Never did that before.
I wonder—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he stopped, pulling the reins taut.
Above him, outlined against the eastern sky,
was the figure of a man on horseback. As he
rode closer, a red beam from the setting sun
shot through the trees and illuminated his face
like a spotlight. Teddy gave a yell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nick! Nick Looker! Yo-o-o, Nick! How
do I get out of here? Where’s Roy? Hey-y-y,
Nick!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span><h1>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>The Slouching Rider</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>Nick Looker’s answer winged down on the
evening breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yo-o, Ted! What you say-y-y? Where you
been?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do I get out of here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“South! Keep south! Straight out from
the gully! Then bear west! I’ll meet you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a throb of sudden hope in his heart that
Nick had found Roy, Teddy turned Flash about
and rode rapidly in the direction Nick had indicated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the boy is hurrying to meet the young
puncher on the trail above him, a few moments
will be taken to tell something of Roy and
Teddy Manley of the X Bar X Ranch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two brothers had been born on their
father’s ranch, and, with the exception of the
three years they had spent at the Hopper
Boarding School, just outside of Denver, they
had lived the rugged life of the cowboy. Although
their father was more than moderately
well off, he, as a Westerner of the old school,
determined that his boys should have every
chance the West offered them to grow into
hardy men. Hence it was that they were an
important part of the “working crew” on the
X Bar X.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As related in the first book of this series,
called “The X Bar X Boys on the Ranch,” Roy
and Teddy succeeded in obtaining information
which led to the capture of a band of rustlers
at the very moment they had planned to steal
cattle from the Manley range. Among these
men was Gilly Froud, who was despised even
by his cronies because of his cruelty to horses
and his mean, avaricious spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was this coward who, out of revenge for a
fancied wrong done him by Mr. Manley, had
stolen General, Star, and Flash, the especial
horses of Mr. Manley, Roy, and Teddy. That
theft was his undoing, for the two boys and
their father were determined to recover their
favorite mounts at all costs. The many exciting
adventures which led to their recovery and the
jailing of most of the rustlers, are told of in
the book preceding this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this explanation, let us return to Teddy
as he is riding to meet Nick Looker, a cowboy
of the X Bar X outfit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following Nick’s instructions, the boy bore
south out of the gully. Then, in a moment, he
spotted a well worn trail, and, practically of
his own accord, Flash made for this at a gallop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right under my nose and I couldn’t see
it!” Teddy murmured bitterly. “What a fine
Westerner I am! If I had found this sooner
I’d be almost home by now and we could have
started after Roy that much quicker. There’s
just a chance that Nick saw him—just a chance.
Baby, I sure hope he has!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eager to set his mind at rest, he touched
Flash impatiently with his heels. The horse,
who was doing his best over the rough ground,
turned his head as if in reproach. Teddy
grinned slightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, ole hoss,” he said. “Go ahead.
Don’t mind me. Guess I’m kind o’ nervous.
But you can’t blame me now, can you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment, when Teddy was most concerned
over his brother’s safety, Roy was
within a quarter of a mile of him, across the
gully, himself riding toward Nick Looker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the landslide came, Roy, realizing his
danger, had snapped Star into action with a
sudden yell. The next moment the pall of dust
hid everything, and Roy had to give his safety
into the keeping of his pony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Star did not fail him. Taking a direction at
right angles and to the left of the route Flash
had picked, the bronco sought to avoid the
rumbling slide by long, desperate bounds.
Somehow, he had chosen the only avenue of
escape left to him. As he shot over the mountain,
Roy noticed that they were leaving the
landslide behind. In a few moments he and
Star stood in safety, while in the distance the
rocks still crashed down the slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Teddy’s first thought had been for his
brother, so now Roy hoped fervently that
Teddy had succeeded in riding clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped and looked about him. The
thunder of the landslide had died to an echo,
and Roy knew that within five minutes the
earth would settle entirely. Still it would not
be exactly safe to ride over that stretch of
mountain for some time, as the least disturbance
might start another slide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if she starts, she starts,” Roy said
aloud. “I’ve got to find Teddy! If he’s off his
horse, he’ll want to ride double with me. Guess
Star can hold us; hey, old boy? Get along
now. Tread easy. Don’t go kicking about or
you’ll have the whole mountain on top of us.
All right, mosey!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diagonally across the mountain he rode, his
eyes narrowing as the sun neared the horizon
and Teddy was still missing. Yet, he thought,
no news is good news, and Teddy might even
now be waiting at the ranch for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the best of his knowledge, the trail he
rode led toward the X Bar X. If Teddy was
really lost, it would be best to make for home
and send out a searching party. One man could
do nothing in this trackless, wild country.
Turning in his saddle, Roy squinted at the descending
sun, now a dull red ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it on the run, Star,” he said aloud, in
a somewhat anxious voice. “Night, she’s coming.
Want to find out if Teddy got home safe.
If not—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not complete his thought, but let the
reins hang loosely over the bronco’s neck. Star
eased into a gallop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose we’re going right,” Roy remarked
after a moment. “Seems as though the
ranch should be due east. When that slide
came, we were—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cutting the sentence off sharply, he pulled
back on the reins with all his strength. Star
slid forward on stiffened legs, reared, and came
to rest within a foot of the edge of the gully.
From where Roy sat, it appeared that the
pony’s head hung over the cliff while the horse
himself remained on solid land only by dint of
clinging to the earth with his tail, or perhaps
with his hind feet, to help him. The boy took a
deep breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it’s all the same to you, Star, maybe
you’d be just as happy a little farther back.
Hey? Easy, now—there’s no rush. Let’s not
do anything sudden. Easy! That’s the stuff.
Whew!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pushing back his sombrero, Roy mopped his
forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he dismounted and walked forward, to
part the bushes and investigate the canyon before
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s deep, all right, and wide,” he mused.
“Not a chance to jump it—here, at any rate.
Funny I don’t remember this. Well—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head jerkily, in the gesture of
a person casting an unpleasant thought from
him. Walking swiftly to where he had left
Star, he remounted and started silently to follow
the canyon. Turning from side to side, so
that he might not miss Teddy if the boy were
in that vicinity, Roy, glancing to the south,
away from the gully, gave a start. In the distance,
far up the mountain, he could see the
figure of a man on horseback.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teddy!” he yelled, then the next moment
regretted it. That was not Teddy. He rode
differently, slouched to one side. Quickly Roy
moved out of sight behind a bush and peered
through. The man was gone. Roy could not
tell whether he had heard his hail or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jimminy! he looked familiar.” The boy
was puzzled. “I’ve seen a rider just like that
somewhere. I wonder if—” Then he smiled
to himself at the absurdity of it. The rustlers
they had captured were in jail at Hawley.
That fellow who had wanted to shoot Froud for
knifing his friend Brand was certainly behind
bars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It couldn’t have been him up there! Yet
that slouch and the queer way he held his
shoulders!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy had not known how vividly the picture
of that night had been impressed in his memory.
The ride to the north fence—the long
wait—then the coming of the rustlers with
Froud leading them and the others following,
among them one with that strange slouch. No,
Roy had not consciously marked the peculiarity
of that side-riding horseman. Yet now, when
he saw one who recalled the scene, he pictured
the rider almost as vividly as if he were before
his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keenly the boy swept the mountain top with
his gaze, but the puncher had disappeared.
Roy shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess I’ll never know,” he commented
grimly. “But how could it be that rustler when
he’s over in Hawley playing solitaire in a cell?
My eyes must be doing tricks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Star whinnied softly, recalling Roy from his
reverie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, baby,” the boy said with a little
chuckle. “You’re a grand little alarm-clock,
I’ll tell a maverick! Let’s be going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the disappearance of the strange horseman,
Roy’s mind reverted to Teddy with a sickening
fear. A frown came to his face and he
chirped to Star, who was moving restlessly forward.
With a jump the pony went into a
gallop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, you!” came a sudden call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy jerked his head around in amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where you bound for? Eagles, to get the
evenin’ mail?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A puncher rode into the open and approached
Roy. His tanned face wore a broad
grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s yore hurry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nick! Have you seen Teddy? Is he
safe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, he’s safe!” the cowboy chuckled.
“Safe an’ sound. He’ll be here in a minute.
I spotted him followin’ the gully like a lost
sheep. Listen! Think I hear him now.
Say—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Roy waited no longer. With a yell he
started Star toward the sound of the approaching
horseman. In a moment the two brothers
were face to face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teddy! I was afraid you were—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They both stopped. Teddy thrust out his
hand, and, for a brief moment, it met Roy’s in
a firm grip that spoke of what was in the heart
of each. Then Teddy chuckled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite a show, hey, Roy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell a maverick! But, Teddy, when the
rocks were busting down a mile a minute and
roaring like thunder and the dust started to
rise, didn’t it remind you of—now tell the truth—didn’t
it remind you of the eruption of the
volcano in ‘The Fall of Pompeii?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy laughed softly, and side by side the
two boys rode toward the X Bar X. Nick,
whistling softly, led the way. The sun flashed
a last blaze of orange and pink as it sank behind
the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far to the rear, on the mountain top, was a
lone horseman, his hand shading his eyes, peering
intently at the three riders. Silent and immobile
as a statue he sat, slouching sideways
in the saddle, as though he were discouraged
and weary after a long, long ride.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>A Message in the Night</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>At the ranch that evening, there was much
talk of the landslide and of how Nick came
upon the two boys “wanderin’ around within
five hundred yards of each other an’ each thinkin’
the other was settin’ on the ground, tossin’
little rocks after big ones,” which was Nick’s
way of telling of the incident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manley, the soul of bluff friendliness
and humor, laughed until the ends of his long
black mustache curled inward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Manley, she whom the boys and
their father often called, half jokingly, half
seriously, “the blonde angel of the West,”
smiled tenderly. Now that the danger was over,
she would not worry. Still in her mother’s
heart was a prayer of thankfulness for the boys’
safety. Often had she watched her sons off on
a dangerous mission with a laugh on her lips
and anguish in her soul, but they never knew
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps Mr. Manley suspected, for at times
he would gather her in his arms without a word
of warning, and in a soft voice ask her if she
was sorry she had come out to “this roughneck
West where there’s nothin’ but cyclones
an’ wild steers an’ rustlers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she would lift her face to his, her eyes
shining with just a hint of tears—of happiness,
and in a moment Mr. Manley’s laugh would go
booming out into the sunny yard. Seldom
would she answer his question. He knew the
reply without being told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belle Ada, the daughter of the family, she of
the dark eyes and wavy black hair, characterized
by Sing Lung, the cook, as “Plitty like
litta’ black jade house-god,” was disappointed
that Teddy had not brought home the porcupine.
Belle was twelve years old, and a fitting
partner for Teddy when any joke was afoot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could have had loads of fun with him,”
she declared. “Golly! Imagine Pop Burns
trying to get him to shoot his quills! I know
we could have fixed up something, maybe with
rubber bands, so when Pop went near him the
quills would shoot! Of course I don’t say we
<span class='it'>could</span> have. I just say maybe. But, anyway—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, take it easy!” Teddy interrupted.
“We haven’t got old Needleback; so what’s the
use of supposing? You’re lucky to have us
back at all, Miss Maybe. Do you realize that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bugs,” Belle stated definitely, with that
callousness so attractive in sisters of twelve.
“I know you and Roy. It ’ud take more than
a landslide to put you under. Like that time
you went after the rustlers. If I could have
come with you, I’ll bet none of them would
have gotten away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that so!” Roy interrupted, getting up
from the steps of the front porch, where he had
been sitting, and walking toward Belle. “Is
that so! How would you work? What would
you do? Shoot ’em all? Would you? Would
you? Would—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roy Manley, don’t you touch my hair! I
just combed it! Roy! If you don’t stop—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a bound, Roy cleared the railing, while
Belle stood in mock fury, shaking her fist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Teddy,” the departed brother
called back. “Let’s go see Nick down at the
bunk-house. We can’t be bothering with children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a laugh, Teddy arose and followed his
brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see you later,” he whispered as he
passed Belle. “Think up a good one, and I’ll
help you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Approaching the bunk-house, the two boys
saw that Nick, Pop Burns, and Gus Tripp were
leaning against the side talking—“settling
their supper.” In the dusk of the evening,
they resembled a picture, so quietly did they
stand. The cowboy will seldom move unless it
is necessary, but at those times he makes up for
his former quiescence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Greetings, boys,” Teddy called softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to you, great chiefs, the blessing of
the harvest moon,” came from Gus. “What
brings you-all to the abode of the humble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make talk,” Teddy grunted. “Where do
you get that ‘humble’ stuff? Been getting
more love letters, Gus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You tell ’em,” Pop chuckled. “Pop” was
the oldest puncher on the X Bar X. He claimed
to have invented the brand of the Manley
ranch when the present owner’s father first
settled it. Thus he felt entitled to a certain
consideration from the “youngsters,” as he
called the other hands. This respect he often
sought to enforce by criticizing the rising generation,
much to his later dismay. In the
words of Nick, they “hopped all over him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind about my love letters,” Gus
responded, grinning. “I guess Nick, here, can
tell us all we want to know about love. He’s
the hombre that writes the ‘advice to the lovelorn’
in the <span class='it'>Hawley Register</span>; ain’t you, Nick?
An’ I know where he gets his dope from, too!
Me, if I liked Norine as well as you do, I’d
marry the girl, that’s what I’d do! Yessir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dry up,” Nick growled. Norine was the
daughter of Mrs. Moore, a widow, who for
many years had been the housekeeper at the
ranch house of the X Bar X. Norine was Irish—and
pretty. Nick was not the only puncher
on the ranch who had fallen a victim to her
charms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep, these kids amuse me,” Pop chuckled,
sliding gently down the side of the bunk-house
until he sat upon the ground, when he proceeded
to light and fill a pipe. “They sure
tickle me! Talkin’ about love! Huh! Why,
you birds don’t know what love means. Me,
I had experience. First gal I ever loved was
the dar’ter of a bouncer in a drinkin’ place
over Tacoma way. She was a gal fer yuh!
Shoot? That gal could shoot the eye outta a
fly at ten paces. That’s the reason I didn’t
marry her. She was <span class='it'>too</span> good. The next one
was—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw, take a rest!” Nick exploded. “How
do you get thataway? Must think you’re King
Solomon, or somebody! Pop, there’s only one
trouble with you. You’re too verbose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here!” the old man sat upright, startled.
“Don’t go callin’ names at me, Nick, ’cause I
won’t have it. I’m tellin’ yuh now, I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it easy, Pop,” Roy broke in. “That
doesn’t mean anything to get sore about. It
means you talk too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” Pop returned, mollified. “I thought
it meant somethin’ else. Got to be careful
these days, with all the youngsters readin’
dictionaries. When I was your age, Nick, all
my knowledge I got out of Harvey’s Encyclopedia
an’ an almanack containin’ the names of
every bird, animal an’ fish in creation, with a
remedy for all ills the flesh is heir to. Yep, an’
she stood me in good stead, too. I remember
the time—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gettin’ late,” Gus declared, stretching
high. “Got a pack of tobacco, Nick? I’m all
out. Say, what you boys been doin’ all day?
Seems like I heard some talk of a landslide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was us,” Teddy said grimly. He told
the story of their escape once more, since Nick
had not yet repeated it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess you were glad to be on the backs of
Flash an’ Star,” Gus commented when Teddy
had finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell a maverick we were!” Roy burst
out. “Those horses are almost human! Now
you take that jump that Flash made, with
Teddy on him. I saw the place, and, baby, it
was some leap! How many horses could do
that? Then when I gave Star his head, as the
rocks started to play tag with me, why, he knew
which way to go. Brought me right out of it.
By golly, I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess during the time the rustlers had
them broncs you didn’t lose any love for ’em,
did ya?” Nick remarked dryly. “Well, you’re
right, Roy. They’re sure some horses!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t tell me different!” Teddy agreed.
“Say, Roy, did you let the boys know about
that rider you saw on the mountain? Maybe
they know who it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was that?” Gus asked quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, nothing much,” Roy answered, “except
that I saw a man who looked a great deal
like one of those punchers we rounded up when
they tried to steal our cattle. As I remember
there was one hombre who sat kind of slouched
in the saddle—leaning to the left. Any of you
recall that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” Nick stated definitely. “When he
heard that Froud had knifed Brand, he took a
pot shot at him, only he missed. Sure, I remember
that slouch. But as far as I know he’s
in the hoosegow at Hawley. There were only
three of the rustlers that made a getaway.
That waddy who rides leanin’ in his saddle we
got. Still, I reckon there’s more than one
side-winder in these parts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess so,” Roy said musingly. He stared
up at the sky through which tiny stars were
now peeping. “Going to be a nice day to-morrow,”
he said in a low tone. “Just right
for a ride. Maybe—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” Teddy repeated. “Why not?
I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh?” Roy came to with a jerk and looked
at his brother. “What do you mean—you’ll
come with me? Do you think you’re a mind
reader?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure do,” Teddy replied, grinning broadly.
“Guessed right, didn’t I? You mean to ride
over to the 8 X 8 and see Nell and Ethel, don’t
you? Oh, never mind denying it. Anyway, I’ll
go along to see that you get there all right.
Can’t have bogie-mans get my ’ittle brother.
No, sir! Would be terrible. Would be awful.
Would be—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chuck it,” Roy growled, making a pass at
Teddy. “If you come along, it’s not to save
me from any bogie-man. It’s for just one thing—to
see Curly! Hey, Pop, what about that?
You qualify as an expert. What should a man
do when he wants to see a girl and she’s ten
miles off on another ranch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buy an airship,” Pop chuckled. “Then
you can make flyin’ visits. Pete Ball would
be glad to see you comin’, I know. He’d maybe
climb up on the roof an’ wave to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re all locoed, I think,” Teddy said
casually. “I’m going in. Got some work to
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea, work! Going to write a note to Curly
because too many people may listen in if you
telephone! Do you call that work?” gibed
Roy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not—anything but!” returned
Teddy. “The note wouldn’t be poetry though,”
and he grinned at his brother, who was a lover
of verse. “Say, Gus,” he went on in a different
tone of voice, “how’s that cow that was sick?
Getting better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s comin’ along all right, Teddy,” Gus
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manley gave the charge of the ranch
over to the boys on alternate weeks, and this
week Teddy was the foreman. He was responsible
for the management of the entire business
of the X Bar X.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let her mix with the others until she’s
entirely well,” Teddy went on. “We don’t
want any more sickness on our hands. Well,
see you boys in the morning. Coming in,
Roy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not just yet. I want to—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy had been facing Nick while he was talking,
and now he stopped suddenly and whirled
about. From around the corner of the bunk-house
came the clatter of a pony’s feet. The
five men stood perfectly still, waiting. The
rider appeared, flashing through the night like
an apparition. His hat was pulled low over
his eyes, and Teddy noticed that he rode not
straight up, but leaning to the left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close to the five punchers he swung. When
he got opposite them, he yelled something and
tossed a light stick at Roy. Fluttering from
the stick was a piece of white paper. The next
moment the rider had swept out of sight behind
the bunk-house. The beating of his pony’s
feet upon the hard earth sounded loud, then
the noise grew gradually fainter and at last
died away in the distance. He went as he had
come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy stooped forward and picked up the
stick with the paper tied to it. He walked into
the bunk-house and held it under the lamp.
The others crowded around eagerly. Teddy
spread the paper out. On it were scribbled the
words:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;'>“Bardwell Manley:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you press the charge against those men
at Hawley you’ll get yours with interest. Take
our advice and let it drop if you want to stay
healthy. We mean what we say.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>Reltsur.</span>”</p>

</div>

<div><span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span><h1>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>The Jumping Bucker</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>The bunk-house lamp illuminated the faces
of five very much surprised cow-punchers.
Teddy, who was holding the note, turned it
over as though the explanation of its strange
arrival might be printed on the back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Pears like we’re a gang of hicks,” Gus
drawled. “Nick, why didn’t you stop that guy?
Maybe he could have told us when he was appointed
postman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you stop him yourself?” Nick
snorted. “You were as near to him as I was.
He rode by almost on yore feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Notice anything queer about the way he
rode?” came from Pop. The veteran puncher
pulled at his pipe calmly and surveyed the men
about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” Teddy answered. “He was
slouched to the left, like he was aiming to sweep
something up from the ground. Why, say, Roy,
he might have been—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He might have been and was,” Roy returned
grimly. “I’ll take a bet that he was the
same hombre I saw back on the trail!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean the waddy you thought was one
of the rustlers?” Pop asked curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s just what I mean. Of course I
didn’t get a very good look at him as he flashed
by, but he sure looked familiar. What was
that he yelled out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t get it,” Nick replied. “Don’t
matter, anyway. Now about this note. What’ll
we do with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give it to Sing Lung to make a stew out
of,” Pop suggested ironically. “Or maybe
you’d rather frame it? But unless you want to
do that, it <span class='it'>might</span> be a good idea to show it to
the boss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead, ride right on,” Nick growled.
“I’m just standin’ here. Roy, you want to
take it in to your dad, an’ see what he thinks
of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. Let’s go, Teddy. Dad’s in his room,
I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment a step sounded at the door,
and all turned quickly—more quickly, perhaps,
than such an interruption at another time
might merit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this, a meetin’ of discontented
workers?” a voice asked, and chuckled.
“Seems to me you might close the screen unless
you <span class='it'>like</span> bugs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boss!” Gus exclaimed. “Hey, take a look
at this, boss! Just came. By pony express,
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guy rode up, goin’ like a jack-rabbit,” Nick
began, “an’ tossed this here—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just this second,” came from Pop. “I was
standin’ by the door, talkin’ to Nick an’ Roy
an’ Teddy an’ Gus, an’ I was just sayin’ that
these days ain’t like the old days when I fust
came here an’ invented the X Bar X brand,
when all of a sudden, boss, I heered a pony
come tearin’ toward—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in thunderation?” demanded Mr.
Manley, taking the paper Teddy held silently
out to him. Quickly his eyes ran over the
words. As he read his lips closed together
tightly. Then he looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This ain’t a joke?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not any!” Teddy exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell a maverick it isn’t!” Roy cried.
“At least, it doesn’t look like one. It happened
just as Pop said when he started that speech of
his. We were standing at the door, talking,
and a rider came out of the dark and threw this
at us, tied to this stick. Then he beat it again
before we could wink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Mr. Manley said nothing. He
pulled first one side of his mustache, then the
other. Then he put the paper in his pocket,
took out a corncob pipe, filled, and lit it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Regular Wild West stuff,” he remarked
slowly, removing the pipe from his mouth.
“Deadeye Bill. Well, let him have his little
fun. He don’t annoy us any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you goin’ to do?” Pop asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me?” Mr. Manley turned to the speaker, a
surprised look on his face. “Why, I’m goin’
to hit the hay pretty soon. Gettin’ kind of late.
She’s sure some warm out, ain’t she? We’ll
probably have a long Indian summer. Nick,
will you see that General is saddled for me
early to-morrow? Want to take a ride over
Hawley way. Got somethin’ I want to tell the
sheriff. Well, I’ll be gettin’ back. Watch out
for that door, Gus, or you’ll have all the gnats
an’ millers in the whole state flyin’ around in
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a glance toward Roy and Teddy, the
ranch owner stepped out into the night. Gus
chuckled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s some worried, ain’t he? They might
just as well have written ‘Merry Christmas’ on
that note for all the boss cares.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man that tries to buffalo dad has got a
mean job on his hands,” Roy declared, with a
grin. “He’ll push that charge now harder than
he would have before. Well, I’ll tell you one
thing. Froud didn’t have a hand in this. He
knows dad—and with good reason. He’d never
send a note like this if he really wanted the
charge dropped. He’d know it would be the
one sure way of getting dad to force it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right, Roy,” Teddy remarked.
“This was written by one of the men that got
away. Wouldn’t be surprised if old Slouch
himself did the job. Must think he’s some hot
stuff! Well, he’ll learn. He sure will. He’s
young yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check,” Nick agreed, with a laugh.
“Teddy, yore dad is one fine man; you know
it? Best boss I ever had. I’m sure glad he’s
not gonna be scared out of puttin’ those rustlers
in jail for a long stretch. Yessir, I’m fer
the boss every time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me too,” came from Gus emphatically.
“Ever since that day he went into Rimor’s
place and took a chance on gettin’ plugged in
the back just to get some information about
the stolen horses, I knew he was the man for
me. Notice how he took that note? Never
batted an eye. They have to come pretty high
to stop him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure do,” Teddy assented. Then he
laughed. “I knew dad ’ud take it that way.
Now he’ll go over to Hawley in the morning
just to tell the sheriff to convict those rustlers
sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m sure glad of it,” Gus declared.
“If I can, I’ll ride over myself when they get
sentenced! The dirty thieves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The puncher has small use for rustlers. The
labor of raising cows until they are fit to sell
cannot be lightly forgotten and the rustler who
steals them is hated with the vindictiveness of
a man who has seen his hard work go for
nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, Teddy and Roy strolled back to the
ranch house, leaving Pop to explain to unwilling
listeners how the mysterious rider had
come and gone so quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys were tired, as well they might be,
and sought their beds early. They roomed together,
their beds being in a room facing the
east. The sun was their alarm clock, and the
next morning they arose and hurried down to
breakfast with an idea of riding with their
father to Hawley. But they found he had already
left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The business of the ranch occupied the attention
of the brothers until early afternoon,
and they had little time to talk of the events
of the preceding night. Four new horses had
arrived at the X Bar X, and both Teddy and
Roy were eager to see if they would make good
saddle ponies. Of course the boys were bound
to their own mounts by ties of real affection,
but it was necessary that some additional riding
broncos be made ready each year for the
fall round-up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy, upon investigation of the newly arrived
animals, declared that while three seemed
fair enough, the fourth had a queer look in his
eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Nick saw the bronco, he grunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad actor,” he said. “I know them kind.
Send him back. Tell Clews we don’t want no
tigers on this ranch. When’d the broncos arrive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little while ago. I kind of hate to send this
pony back, though. Look at the chest on him,
won’t you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea, an’ did you take a look at his teeth?
Made fer bitin’, they are. Better send him
back than have him take a chunk out of somebody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think he’d do that?” Roy asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure do! If you don’t believe it, just you
fork him—only leave word what kind of
flowers you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, I don’t know about that,”
Teddy said slowly. He walked over to where
the horse stood, rubbing against the bars of
the corral, and peered into his eyes. “He
doesn’t look so bad. Nick, I’d like to take a
crack at him. Lend a hand with this cinch, will
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Teddy,” Nick remonstrated.
“Don’t do nothin’ foolish. Even if he don’t
bite, he’s a buckin’ fool. I’m certain sure of
that. Why take a chance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Teddy, if I were you I’d wait until dad
comes back,” Roy added. “He may want to
return the pony. Don’t ride him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy did not answer for a moment. Then
he took a coin from his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heads I do, tails I don’t,” he said briefly.
“Dad won’t want to send the bronc back without
knowing what he’s good for. The only way
to find out, so far as I can see, is to ride him.
Here she goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy spun the coin in the air. As it
landed, both Nick and Roy bent over it eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heads,” Nick reported. “Now watch your
step, Teddy. I know you can ride, but I don’t
want to see you ploughin’ a trench in the dirt.
I’ll get this here cinch strap good an’ tight, so
the saddle won’t sway none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In silence the horse was made ready. Teddy
stood by his side, and at a signal from him, Roy
and Nick stood away. Teddy vaulted into the
saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The animal stood like a statue. Not a
muscle moved. Teddy whipped his hat from
his head and “fanned” the pony. And this
time he got results. Straight into the air the
animal leaped, landing with legs as stiff as
boards. But Teddy was ready for this maneuver,
and took the shock with his feet firm in the
stirrups.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stick to him!” Nick yelled. “Watch out
that he doesn’t swing his head on you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The warning came not a moment too soon,
for the horse flung his head around savagely
and bared his teeth. But these teeth never met
in Teddy’s flesh, for at the same instant the
boy sawed fiercely on the reins, jerking the
head straight again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the bronco settled down to the business
on hand, and showed the two breathless watchers
some of the finer points of bucking. But
Teddy stuck, and not once did he “go to
leather,” as gripping the pommel of the saddle
is called. At the end of several minutes, each
of which seemed an eternity, the pony stopped
as suddenly as he began, cocked one eye at the
top rail of the corral fence, and sprang again
into action, this time on a dead run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch it!” Roy yelled. “He’ll never make
it, Teddy! Pull him up! Pull him up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Teddy had a look in his eyes not unlike
the fire that gleamed in the eyes of the bronco.
He was doing no “pulling up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeo-o-o-ow!” he shouted. “Go to it!
We’re off! Baby, if you clear that—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no time for more. The horse had
reached the rails. Teddy felt the muscles of
his mount contract like steel springs, and then
he was flying through the air, up, up, up—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s over!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man, what a jump!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hind feet of the horse had just grazed
the top bar. And now he stood outside the
corral, trembling violently, but, somehow, appearing
as if in making the tremendous leap
he had proved himself and would henceforth
be content with this. In other words, it seemed
as though he had changed in a second from
a “bad actor” to a real saddle horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy gently rubbed the sides of the sweating
animal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right now, old boy?” he asked. “No
more fireworks? Guess he’ll do, Nick. Some
one must have been feeding him on yeast.
That was some jump!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell a maverick it was!” Roy was
hurrying toward his brother. “Boy, you’re
lucky! I never thought he’d make it. And
with that extra bar dad put up! That bronc is
a <span class='it'>jumper</span>. What do you say, Nick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure is!” Nick approached, and gazed at
the horse closely. “Salivate me if he ain’t as
gentle-eyed as a rabbit! Teddy, you cured him.
Didn’t think it could be done. If I know anything
about horses, that one’ll make a fine
ridin’ pony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy climbed off, stiff legged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He put on quite a show for a while, didn’t
he? All right, Nick, let down the bars an’ we’ll
bring him in again. I’ll have another look at
him to-morrow. Want to make sure he’s
broken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later the boys were saddling their
own mounts, Flash and Star. The new pony
was standing calmly within the corral, and
Teddy grinned at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad ought to be back soon,” Roy remarked,
and he slid the bit gently into Star’s mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wish we’d gone along with him,” came
from Teddy. “Say, we could ride part of the
way to meet him. How about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” and Roy grinned. “The 8 X 8 is on
the way to Hawley, isn’t it? Yea, let’s start to
meet him. But if we reach Pete Ball’s place,
we won’t stop in. Oh, no!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chuck it,” Teddy replied. “You know
you’re anxious to see Nell. Come on, let’s be
on our way.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Bad News</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy treated the riding of the wild bronco
as an incident in the day’s work. It might well
have turned out disastrously for him, but, now
that it was over, the youth thought no more
about it except to remember that it would be
well to ride him again to-morrow before the
pony forgot his lesson. Thus, while the two
boys rode toward Hawley, their conversation
was mostly taken up with the note Mr. Manley
had received and the possibility of trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though I don’t see exactly what they could
do,” Roy mused, shifting in his saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day was warm, even for Indian summer,
the heat seemed to beat up from the stretch
of bare ground the boys were riding over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t understand it!” exclaimed Teddy.
“Those hombres are in jail, aren’t they? What
in thunder can they do? Unless they have a
gang of friends around. And that isn’t so
likely. Honestly, I don’t believe that Gilly
Froud has a friend in the world. Why, even
the men he rustled with, hate him. I guess we
can count him out, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy removed his sombrero and ran his finger
around the sweat band, bringing it forth as wet
as though he had dipped it in a pail of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not worrying about Froud,” he stated,
picking up his reins, which he had allowed to
fall loosely on Star’s neck. “He’s had his turn
and has said his little piece. He won’t do any
more talking in public for a long time. But I
tell you, Teddy, that puncher with the riding
slouch has got me thinking. How about it—was
he one of the rustlers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Question—who struck Bill Patterson?”
Teddy grinned. “That reminds me. Mother
said that Curly—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leaping lizards!” Roy groaned. “Can’t
you be serious for a minute? This is important,
I tell you! Suppose the rustlers—er—well,
suppose they—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! They <span class='it'>couldn’t</span> do that! You know
they couldn’t! That ’ud be fearful—simply
fearful! And, besides, I think it’s going to
rain to-morrow. No rustler wants to go out in
the rain. ’Cause why? ’Cause somebody has
to tell them to come in, and if there’s no one
around, they just get al-l-l-l wet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there’s another thing,” Roy went on,
ignoring his brother’s somewhat sarcastic
levity. “What or who is ‘Reltsur?’ I mean
the name that was signed to the note.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know!” Teddy’s face was alight with a
sudden idea. “There’s a fellow down at Eagles
who just came to town. Gus Tripp was telling
me about him—said he saw him when he rode
in for the mail yesterday. Well, this geezer—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about him?” Roy asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sells patent medicine! And I bet Reltsur
is the name of one of his cures. Good for
man or beast—positive cure or your money
back. Read our testimonials. Mr. L. J. McPhoff,
of Chickawalla, says: ‘I have used Reltsur
now for thirteen years. When I started I
was only twenty years old. Now, I’m thirty-three.’
Or hear what Mr. Specknoodle reports:
‘I highly recommend Reltsur for—’ Hey, cut it
out! Don’t get that hat dirty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was too late. Roy had scaled his
brother’s sombrero as far as he could. Then
he clucked to Star, and, yelling like an Indian,
bore down upon the hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pony express!” he yelled. “Buck Wallace
in his famous picture ‘The Bad man of the Bad
Lands!’ You! Yip-yip-e-e-e-e!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaning over, he swept the hat from the
ground as he dashed by. Then he wheeled, and,
with a bow, presented it to Teddy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just found it,” he said, with a grin.
“Yours, maybe? Allow me! Rather warm
isn’t it? But it’ll be cooler this winter, I expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My nice new Stetson,” Teddy remarked
ruefully as he dusted it off. “Suppose Star
had stepped on it? Fine pony express you
are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t,” Roy said, with a laugh. “Now
what was that about Curly, Teddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, who do <span class='it'>you</span> think Reltsur is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy let out a roar of laughter. Then for
some minutes Teddy was content to discuss
their visitor of the night, but neither of the
boys reached any conclusion, and at last they
dismissed the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both were eager to hear what their father
had to report when he returned from Hawley.
The trail they were on led to the town where
the rustlers were jailed, and the boys had hopes
of meeting Mr. Manley on his way home. Yet
the 8 X 8 Ranch was not out of their way, and
if they missed their father, Teddy and Roy
would not be at all averse to stopping off for
a short visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 8 X 8 was owned by Peter Ball, a neighbor
and friend of Bardwell Manley. His two
nieces from New York were paying their first
visit to the West, and, as Teddy had said, they
were planning to stay all winter at the Ball
ranch. Since the girls were young and comely,
it is not to be wondered at that Teddy and Roy
took advantage of every opportunity to see
them. Ethel Carew, or “Curly,” as the boys
called her, seemed to hold special attraction
for Teddy, while Nell Willis and Roy found
each other’s company mutually agreeable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, while both boys declared their purpose
in riding out was to meet Mr. Manley, they
would not bother to avoid the 8 X 8 by circuitous
riding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After his imitation of the “pony express,”
Roy settled into a moody silence, which all
Teddy’s efforts failed to disperse. Roy was
given to these spells of thoughtfulness, though
perhaps more so lately than before. His
brother had accused him of being in love, but
Roy denied this so calmly that Teddy knew
that the thrust was ineffectual. The only other
conclusion was that the older youth felt a responsibility
growing with his years, and was
taking more of a burden upon his shoulders
than the occasion warranted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they rode along, Teddy stole a glance at
the boy at his side. He noted the stiffness of
the back, and the firm set of the head upon the
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s worrying about something,” the
younger lad thought. “He always takes everything
so seriously! I’ll bet it’s that note.
Maybe I shouldn’t have kidded him about it.
But, golly, there’s no reason to get so low over
it! Roy!” he said aloud. “Snap out of it!
What’s on your mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who, me?” the other turned, startled.
Then he grinned. “Was I asleep? Guess I
must have been thinking. What was that you
asked me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I just wanted to know what you were
mooning about. You were riding along staring
straight ahead as though you were in a trance.
What in thunder is the matter with you lately,
Roy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing,” the boy answered, laughing a
bit uneasily. “I was wondering about that
note, that’s all. I’d hate to have anything
happen just when we’ve got over our trouble
with the rustlers. Although I’ll admit we had
some exciting times for a while,” and Roy’s
eyes sparkled. Then he grew grave again.
“But dad sort of counts on us to keep things
going, you know. That’s why I’m anxious to
see what he has to say when he gets back from
Hawley. That gang can—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw, what can they do?” Teddy demanded.
“They’re all in jail. Forget about ’em, Roy.
What’s the use of crossing bridges before you
reach ’em?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true enough. But you know I saw
that slouched puncher right after the landslide.
If he’s really one of the rustlers, he doesn’t
bear us any love, I reckon.” The boy patted
Star on the side to brush off a fly. “And seeing
him right after the landslide—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for Pete’s sake!” Teddy burst out,
“you don’t think he started the slide, do you?
Roy, come to life! Be yourself! Now how in
the name of cackling cows could he have anything
to do with that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean that,” he explained. “But it
sure looked as though he’d been following us.
At least it did to me. How’d he know when to
ride by last night? He timed that perfectly!
By jinks, I’ll bet he was watching us all the
time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” Teddy said laconically. “But
wondering won’t get us any place. We’ll have
to sit tight and watch our step, that’s all.
Come on, it’s gettin’ late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they rode forward at a faster gait, Teddy
suddenly called his brother’s attention to a
figure on horseback coming toward them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s dad!” Roy exclaimed. Then, as the
figure neared: “He looks worried, too. Wonder
what happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Howdy, boys!” called Mr. Manley, as he
rode up. “Come to meet the old man, hey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the news, Dad?” Teddy asked
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A frown came to Mr. Manley’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so good,” he said slowly. “We won’t
be able to prosecute those hoss thieves after
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hesitating, he drew a corncob pipe from
his pocket and stuck it between his lips, unlighted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole caboodle of ’em escaped yesterday,”
he added tersely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Escaped? The prisoners?” Roy Manley
looked at his father incredulously. “What do
you mean, Dad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what I said, son,” and the pipe never
wavered between the set teeth. “They took
French leave. Yesterday morning, early—’bout
five o’clock, they said—two men started
to shoot up the town. Of course the sheriff an’
his two deputies got on the job. When they
come back, after chasin’ the gunman out, they
found the jail empty an’ the bars in the windows
sprung. Guess that’s all.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>A Flivver Messenger</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy and Roy looked at each other with
startled eyes. That rider on Mica Mountain,
the puncher who sat slouched in the saddle!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any trace of ’em?” Teddy asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not any, son. They vamoosed clean. But
lemme tell you something funny. Two days
ago they decided the jail was too crowded an’
they moved Froud over to the calaboose in
Marxsted. An’ he’s the only one of the rustlers
they still got! Can you beat that? So, at all
events, Gilly Froud is where he won’t do any
harm. Anything new at the ranch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ride back home was occupied with a discussion
of the situation. Teddy and Roy had,
of course, given up the idea of riding on to the
8 X 8, as they were anxious to know their
father’s plan of action. Yet, as Teddy suggested,
what could they do? It would be useless
to go after the escaped rustlers. Besides,
there was no need for it. Until the enemy
showed his hand, they just had to sit tight.
Of course it would be well to have some extra
men ride herd, but, somehow, both Mr. Manley
and the two boys felt the blow, if it did fall,
would come from another direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe we’re makin’ a mountain out of a
molehill,” Mr. Manley declared, as he stood
near the hitching rail by the corral, the horses
having been watered. “Those hoss thieves are
loose. What more do they want? Why should
they bother us? If they want to start up another
gang and go back to rustling again, that’s
up to them. But I have a hunch that’s not
what they’re after. They’ve had their fill of
that game. And, besides, the sheriff said that
two of those babies came from New York. That
mean anything? Remember the barkeeper in
Rimor’s place who tried to crash me with a
bottle when I went in after that hombre with
the checkered shirt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure do!” Teddy remarked excitedly. “He
came from New York, too, didn’t he? They
must be importing a bunch of gunmen down
here! Do you think the bird in Rimor’s is one
of the gang, Dad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t surprise me a bit,” Mr. Manley
answered. “He’s not there any more, you
know. He ducked out. It may be—I don’t say
it is—but it’s just possible that he and his
friends got the rustlers out of jail. Boys, I
hate to say it, but somehow it looks like trouble
was stirrin’ up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?” Teddy asked insistently.
“What makes you say that, Dad? Roy’s been
like that all day, too. Why the worry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you been thinkin’ too, have you, Roy?”
the ranch owner repeated, glancing over at his
son. “Well, I’ll tell you, Teddy. All of us
have our friends and our enemies. When my
dad—your grandfather, that was—first settled
here there was nothin’ but a lot of space. Pop
Burns can tell you about that. Then later
Eagles came, and with it some punchers that
wanted money without workin’ for it. About
six years ago they wanted me to go into a
scheme of weighting the cattle scales down at
the railroad corral. But I soon set ’em right
on that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy and Roy nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pop told us,” Roy stated. “That put you
sort of in wrong, didn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep. Then a queer gang from the East
began to head for Eagles. You know most of
’em I guess. That barkeeper was the worst of
the lot. They joined up with the element that
had it in for me. You know the result—how
we had our horses stolen and our cattle rustled.
Then, when we landed the gang an’ jailed ’em,
I figured they were out of the way for a while.
But now—they’re out. An’ I get this note.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly he took the paper from his pocket and
gazed at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reltsur,” he mused. “Sounds like a foreign
name. Well, by jinks, whoever he is—”
The man’s eyes blazed and he crumpled the
paper up and flung it savagely from him.
“Whoever he is, if he fools around here he’ll
wish he hadn’t! An’ that’s that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning, he strode into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were right, Roy,” Teddy remarked in
a low voice, watching his father’s form pass
through the door. “Dad does take it seriously.
He’s all het up. I wonder what— Oh, fishcakes!
What’s the use of wondering? I’m going
in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning when Mr. Manley came toward
the bunk-house to speak to one of the
punchers, Nick, who was standing in the doorway,
noticed with surprise that the boss had a
six-gun fastened to his belt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goin’ huntin’, boss?” the puncher asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mebbe,” Mr. Manley answered laconically.
“Want to be ready in case any two-legged
rattlesnakes are wanderin’ around. Where’s
Jim Casey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Around back. Want him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Jim approached he was given directions
to set three more men to riding the cattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell Teddy who they’ll be,” Mr. Manley
directed. “He’s foreman this week. If you
want anything else, ask him. And listen. If
you see any strangers around here, ask ’em
their business. Especially if you see a puncher
that rides leanin’ a little to the left in his
saddle. I guess you all know who I mean. I’m
going to head for town. Be back in a few hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boss means business,” Gus Tripp declared,
when Mr. Manley had left. “There’s
Teddy. Yo-o-o, Teddy! Yore dad was just
here. Told Jim to put some extra riders out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” Teddy nodded. “Who do you
want, Jim? How about Rad Sell, Nat Raymond,
and—well, you want to take it, Gus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” Gus answered. “Nick can hang
around here. But don’t you go serenadin’
Norine, Nick. Guess I’d better have Pop keep
an eye on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dry up!” Nick growled. “You’ll have your
hands full without worryin’ about Norine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment Roy came from the ranch
house and walked toward the group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad around?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just left,” Teddy replied. “Went to
Eagles, didn’t he, Nick? Say, did he have a
gun on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did,” Gus drawled. “Said he might
meet up with some two-legged rattlers. Yore
dad worried about that note, Roy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s sore about it, at any rate,” Roy answered.
“Dad doesn’t like any one to try to
bluff him. Then, too, he’s kind of waiting for
something to start, I think. You knew the
horse thieves that we rounded up are loose
again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep. All our work for nothin’! Well, let
’em try some more rustlin’, that’s all I ask.
<span class='it'>This</span> time we’ll salivate ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad said they might try another game,”
Teddy declared. “He didn’t say what, but he
mentioned the fact that there are several gunmen
from the East mixed up in the crowd.
Can’t tell what that bunch’ll pull. You men
that are riding cattle, don’t stay in one place
too long. Keep moving, and try to ride fence
as much as you can. If you see a break that
looks suspicious, report it. We can’t afford to
take chances, because there’s a big shipment of
Durhams due to go out this month, you know.
For the love of Pete! Look who’s coming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the road swept a cloud of dust, punctuated
by the sound of a horn, and now and
then a hoarse shout. The cloud drew up by the
bunk-house, and slowly drifted away to disclose
a flivver, with a freckled, grinning youth at the
wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Howdy!” this dusty apparition exclaimed.
“It’s me. Me an’ my little peanut roaster.
Waddaya say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Bug Eye!” Teddy cried. “What’s
the news? Why the rush?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rush!” Bug Eye looked at the speaker
reproachfully. “I wasn’t rushin’. I was
goin’ slow! You want to see me when I’m in a
hurry! Er—oh, yea, I knew I came over here
fer somethin’. I got a message fer Belle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bug Eye was a hand on the 8 X 8, and Mr.
Ball frequently made use of him to drive one of
the ranch cars. Bug Eye was always delighted
to oblige, and had almost forsaken horses for
the “puddle jumper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now he reached laboriously inside an upper
pocket of his shirt and unearthed tobacco,
“makin’s,” and finally a soiled envelope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a little dirty,” he apologized, “but I
guess she ain’t hurt none. Got that way from
Lizzie hoppin’ around so much. Baby, this
here tin mule is a flyin’ fool! One minute she’s
on the road an’ the next she’s skimmin’ over a
cloud, or—or somethin’. Want a ride? Take
you any place! I just put in a new dofunny,
an she goes like a jack-rabbit. How about it,
Teddy? Roy? Take a little jaunt? She’s
good. Bust her hide, she’s good! Why, on the
way over I seen a prairie dog that was goin’
the same way I was, an’—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Save it, save it!” Nick yelled. “Why don’t
you write a book, Bug Eye? Snakes! I never
see a man that could talk as much as you an’
say so little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” Bug Eye glanced at Nick calmly.
“Maybe you don’t understand. You know I
talk English, an’ I guess it’s kind of hard for
you birds to catch on. Here’s the note, Roy.
Fer yore sister. Got anything to eat in there,
Gus? Where’s Sing Lung? He ought to have
some beans warmin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy took the missive from Bug Eye, and the
messenger stretched high and entered the
bunk-house, carefully oblivious of Nick’s taunting
reply. The note was addressed to “Miss
Belle Ada Manley,” and, boylike, Roy held it
to his nose and inhaled deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfume?” Teddy asked, grinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tobacco,” Roy answered briefly, making a
wry face. “It was buried in Bug Eye’s pocket.
Let’s take it in to Belle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the ranch house, the two boys stood
about in careless attitudes as their sister
ripped open the envelope. Belle paused and
looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something?” she questioned innocently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Belle—have a heart,” Teddy
murmured. “What’s in it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, this!” The girl looked at the note
calmly. Slowly she read it through, and then
folded it carefully and replaced it in the envelope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” Roy burst out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you want to know what she says?”
Belle asked. “Why, it’s—it’s just a note.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea? What’s it say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Nell and Ethel want me to—is that
mother calling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! Go on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They want me to visit them. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two boys turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they want to be remembered to you
two. And they want you to stay to dinner to-morrow
night when you take me over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they do! Why didn’t you say so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forgot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right!” Teddy and Roy glared in
mock anger. “We’ll remember this!” Then
in chorus, “Re-e-e-e-e-venge!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they stalked out of the room, to execute
a war dance in the hall.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>A Great Fear</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>The incident of the escaped rustlers was forgotten
for the time while Belle prepared for
her visit to the 8 X 8. Mr. Manley discarded
his gun the day she was to leave, whether because
of what he had heard at Eagles or because
he deemed it no longer necessary, was a
matter for speculation. At all events, he had
recovered his good humor and directed many
quips at the care Roy and Teddy were taking
with their appearance before they set out. It
had been arranged that the brothers were to
drive Belle over in a car and return later in
the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see you boys are goin’ some place,” Mr.
Manley said, as he stood at the door of their
room, hands deep in his pockets, corncob pipe
emitting clouds of fragrant smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taking a ride,” Teddy answered, without
turning. He was adjusting his tie at the mirror.
Roy, beside him, was occupied in the same
manner. Teddy just touched his brother with
his elbow, and winked in the glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—er—any particular place?” their
father asked innocently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vienna,” Teddy replied, grinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vienna, hey?” Mr. Manley considered this
for a moment. “Goin’ to a show there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope,” and Teddy winked again. “Just
going to loaf around a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goin’ to loaf around—” Then Mr. Manley
woke up and sent out a roar of laughter.
“Good shot, Teddy! You’re gettin’ better!
Be almost a match for me soon. Well, good
luck to you, an’ don’t take any wooden
nickels!” Still chuckling, he tramped away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad seems to be O. K. now,” Roy remarked,
as he gave his tie a final twist. “I’m
glad to notice it. I don’t like to see him worried.
Come along, you look beautiful! Get a
move on! We’ve got to get started.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a second.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opening the top drawer of the dresser,
Teddy took out two pistols, both smaller than
the large guns usually carried in that vicinity.
One of these he handed to Roy and the other
he placed in an upper inside pocket under his
left arm. Roy nodded in approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just in case,” Teddy explained, and, putting
on their coats, the two boys descended the
stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They told their father, out of hearing of Mrs.
Manley, however, who might worry unnecessarily,
that they were armed. The ranch owner
commended their foresight and remarked that
he was about to suggest it himself. He knew
the boys were to be depended upon. Living on
the range brings self-reliance early in life, and
Mr. Manley felt proud of the fact that his sons
were true men of the West—courageous and
upright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the car rolled out of the ranch yard with
Roy driving and Belle and Teddy beside him in
the front seat, Sing Lung burst from the door
of the cook-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Late!” he yelled. “You late!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s he mean—‘late?’ ” Teddy asked
curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He means wait,” Belle answered, with a
smile. “Hold up for a minute, Roy. He wants
to give us something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sing Lung ran towards them, a package in
his hand. A broad grin lighted his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You maybe get hungly, yes?” he said, placing
the package in Belle’s lap. “I flix lunch!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very kind of you, Sing Lung,” Belle
declared, smiling her gratitude. Belle was
plainly the cook’s favorite. “We’ll be glad
to have this. Thank you, a lot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All lite!” with a still wider grin. “You
wal-com’. Goo’-bye. Have nice time! Jumpee
allee slidewalks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He means skip the gutter,” Teddy explained,
laughing, as the car proceeded.
“Nick must have taught him that. ‘Jump the
slidewalks!’ That’s a hot one! Trust the
Chinks to get everything backwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind; Sing Lung is one good
Chink,” Roy declared. “This lunch will sure
come in handy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Jump the slidewalks’ means ‘skip the gutter,’
and ‘skip the gutter’ means—perhaps,
‘jump the slidewalks?’ Now, just what did Sing
Lung mean, boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Belle’s brothers refused to be drawn
into explanations or argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seven miles out from their home ranch a report
suddenly sounded from under the car, and
it lurched crazily. Roy jammed on the brakes
vigorously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blowout,” he said shortly. “Might have
known that ’ud happen! Just when we get rolling
along nicely, the tire goes. Well,” he
jumped from the car and bent down, “she’s
done for, all right. And any one who pulls that
old chestnut about ‘only flat on one side’ will
have to fix it all alone! Come on Teddy—you
posing for a statue?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy grinned, and alighted, as did Belle.
Luckily, there were two good spares on the
rear, so there was no danger of a long delay.
The jack was soon out, and one of the tires
taken from the rack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Roy had lifted the spare in position
for tightening the lugs, he stood back for a
moment and looked around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a great place for a rattler,” he declared,
wiping the sweat from his brow. “Pop
said he saw a whole nest of ’em somewhere
around here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought you said Pop was full of crazy
ideas?” Teddy retorted, thinking of the porcupine
incident when he had told Roy about
Pop’s believing the “shooting quill” theory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he may not know porcupines, but he
sure does know about snakes,” the elder youth
asserted. “And if you’re wise, you won’t go
fooling around a spot where Pop says there
are rattlers. This is one swell day for ’em,
too! Hand me that lug wrench, will you,
Teddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy complied, and assisted Roy in fastening
the tire to the rim. When it was firmly attached,
Roy straightened and heaved a sigh of
relief. As he did so his eyes swept the horizon,
and he stared intently, one hand shading
his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Roy?” Belle asked, looking at
her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dust,” Roy answered. “See it, Teddy?
Top of that hill. Whoever’s making it must
be just below the rise. Wonder if it’s some of
Pete Ball’s men? Likely to be. Come on, let’s
get this stuff away and start. We haven’t got
far to go, but that sun’s hotter than all get out.
Teddy, how about making yourself useful,
and putting some of these tools away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” his brother answered. “Thought
you wanted to do it all yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pair of pliers had fallen to the ground
from the running board, and Teddy stooped to
pick them up, his other hand resting on the
door of the car, while he groped for the tool,
bending down low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Golly, it’s sure hot!” he exclaimed, still
groping and searching. “Why couldn’t the
tire have blown out under a tree? Say, where
in thunder are those pliers, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe it ’ud help if you <span class='it'>looked</span> for ’em, instead
of watching that cloud of dust,” Roy declared,
grinning. “Belle, can’t you help your
little brother find the pliers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got ’em!” Teddy suddenly exclaimed, as
his hand closed over them. “They were away
under the car, and I couldn’t see gettin’ down
in this dirt to look for ’em. Anyway—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started to withdraw his hand. There was
a sudden loud “whir-r-r” as though a strip of
tin were rapidly bent and released. Roy saw
Teddy’s whole body give a convulsive shudder
and watched his face go deathly pale. Pop
Burns’ warning flashed to his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teddy!” he cried, jumping forward.
“Your hand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belle screamed, and ran to her brother’s
side. Quickly she seized the left arm that had
been under the auto and turned it over so that
the back of the hand was uppermost. A
thin line of blood showed red against the tan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy looked at it as though he were examining
a curiosity. Then he laughed—at least,
that is the only word to describe the sound that
came from his lips. In a moment he stopped,
and caught his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got me,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three stood by the side of the car,
shocked into silence. Belle retained her hold
on Teddy’s arm. Roy, his eyes wide, stared at
the few drops of blood. Teddy’s shoulders
were thrown back, every muscle rigid. He
looked straight ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy was the first to move. He reached out
quickly, and seized his brother’s wrist in a firm
grip, squeezing it with all his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Belle,” he said in a low voice, “reach into
my pocket and bring out a handkerchief.
We’ve got to make a tourniquet, so the poison
won’t get up his arm. Quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drawing in a deep breath, Belle obeyed.
Teddy swayed slightly, then got a grip on himself.
His teeth clenched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roy,” he said quietly, “hold my arm over
a way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wondering, Roy changed his position.
Teddy reached inside his coat with his right
hand, and drew out a gun. Then Roy understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever happened, they must kill that
rattler. He had bitten—he must die. His head
must be blown from his body, and they must
cut him with lead until his lashings ceased and
the tail grew still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eyes blazing, Teddy once more bent over.
Roy retained his desperate grip on his
brother’s wrist. Belle, eyes wide with horror,
stepped back. The scene was almost too much
for her, Western bred though she was. Teddy,
bitten by a crawling death, calmly intent on
just one thing—killing the snake that had bitten
him! Roy holding back the poison from his
brother’s body with one hand, while he
steadied him with the other, so that he might
not miss!</p>

<p class='pindent'>With her heart in her throat, Belle waited
for the shot. After the snake had been killed—what?
She could picture Teddy sitting
stoically in the car as it careened its way toward
the ranch—Teddy, his arm black from
the tourniquet, perhaps remarking that Roy
would have to take charge of the place for the
rest of the week and would he see that Flash
got enough exercise, and all the while his lips
were twisted with burning pain! Teddy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would he never fire? What was he waiting
for?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shoot! Oh, shoot!” Belle gasped. “Teddy—kill
him and come away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the two boys were bent over, staring
beneath the car. Then Belle saw Roy slowly
release his hold on his brother’s wrist. A
sound strangely like a chuckle came from him.
What—what had happened?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teddy! Roy!” Belle cried. “What is it?
Why are you waiting? The snake—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment she thought her brothers had
gone mad, and well she might, for, straightening
up, the boys burst into roars of laughter.
They leaned weakly against the side of the car,
Teddy’s gun hanging limply, his body shaking
with mirth! Roy was pounding him on the
back, while he himself was scarcely able to
stand. This was more than laughter, it was almost
hysteria—the hysteria of great and sudden
relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then when Roy caught sight of his sister’s
face, he sobered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, sis,” he declared, tears of
laughter still in his eyes. “Don’t look so
scared. We’re not crazy—and Teddy isn’t
hurt. He didn’t get bitten by a rattler at all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t—didn’t—get bitten! Roy, I don’t
understand—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He motioned to his sister to bend down and
peer under the car. As he did so Roy’s hand
reached out—and there followed that same
“whir-r-r-r” they had heard before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get it?” Roy exclaimed, his laughter starting
up again. “This—this piece of tin under
the running board! See? When I hit it, it
whirs. Teddy’s hand scraped it, and it buzzed
and scratched his hand. And we thought it
was a rattler! Oh, baby, what a couple of
saps! Wait till dad and Nick hear about this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t get bitten?” Belle repeated,
hardly able to realize what had happened.
“There wasn’t any snake?” she questioned incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nary snake—just this tin! That’s all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a sob of relief, Belle threw her arms
around her brother’s neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Teddy!” she gasped. “I’m so glad—so
glad! Oh, Teddy, I thought you were going
to die! And when you were bending over with
the gun, just thinking about killing the old
rattlesnake, I—I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, sis, come out of it!” Teddy said a
trifle shakily. He kissed her full on the lips.
“Thought you’d have to play jokes on Roy all
alone after this, did you? Well, I’m still here—and
we won’t forget how he teased you the
other night on the porch, either! We’ll get
him for that! I got a great idea—only he’s
listening now. When we get home—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was just this that was needed to calm
Belle. The strain she had been under had been
terrific, and it is no wonder that, when it was
over, she broke down. But now she dried her
eyes and raised her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a piece of tin!” she exclaimed, a smile
coming over her face. “And even Teddy
thought he had been bitten! But whatever it
was—I’m glad you’re all right, Teddy dear!
And now, I have an idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belle was once more herself. Patting her
hair, she walked steadily toward the car. Then
she flung open the door and held up a white
package. It was the lunch Sing Lung had prepared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen,” she cried, “dinner is served!
Long live Sing Lung! Come and get it!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Roy’s Suspicions</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>As the Manley boys and their sister sat in
the car munching sandwiches, now and then
Teddy would glance at his hand, which still
showed the red scratch, and shake his head in
wonder that such a strange mistake could have
happened. It hardly seemed possible that one
could imagine he had been bitten by a rattler
when there was no snake within miles, for all
they knew. Yet, the “whir-r-r” of that tin certainly
did sound like the warning of a side-winder.
And when his hand had been injured
at the same time—what other conclusion could
be drawn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course both Roy and Teddy knew that a
snake’s bite would usually be nothing more
than two small punctures in the flesh, yet if the
hand was being withdrawn when the fangs hit
it, the flesh could easily be torn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two boys and their sister did not talk
much of Teddy’s experience. Somehow, it
hardly seemed the thing to joke about, even
though it had turned out so fortunately. The
laughter of the boys on discovering the piece
of tin was not born of true mirth, but was a
natural outlet for the strain they had been
under.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took some time for the travelers to recover
their usual spirits, but Sing Lung’s food helped
a great deal, and when the sandwiches were finished
they set off once more toward the 8 X 8
with lighter hearts. And as they proceeded,
the reaction set in—a reaction of happy, carefree
joyousness. The boys thought of Nell and
Curly, and, as always happens after a period
of depression, anticipation of coming pleasure
swelled to mountainous proportions in their
minds. The whole world suddenly appeared
rose-colored, and the most prosaic things in it
took on a carnival aspect. The sun-drenched
trees they passed seemed to smile at them. It
was no longer hot, but only pleasantly warm—a
wonderful day for anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yay, look at ole cottontail” Teddy yelled,
pointing ahead. “Go get him, Roy! Step on
it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ri-i-i-ight!” sang out Roy, and pressed the
accelerator. The car shot forward, Belle
mingling her laughter with that of her
brothers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten dollars if you keep that cab in sight!”
she called, melodramatically pointing to the
rabbit scurrying ahead. “And another ten if
you catch it before it reaches the ship! Don’t
spare the horses!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am!” came the answer. “I suppose
Miss Vere De Vere is in it with her uncle,
who is kidnapping her so that he can get
control of the family fortune—the dir-r-r-rty
rat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then some!” Belle laughed, her eyes
sparkling. “Roy, you ought to be on the stage.
Say, you’d better slow down before you get another
blowout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother saw the wisdom of this advice,
and took on a slower pace while the rabbit disappeared
in the brush. The high spirits of the
three were by no means lessened when they
reached the 8 X 8, and they piled out with loud
yells. Nell and Ethel ran into the yard when
they heard the uproar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The stage has arrived!” Teddy shouted,
grinning. “Good morning, Ethel and Nell. I
hope our visit finds you well. It is with great
pleasure we see you again—and—and— Now
what else did mother tell me to say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dry up, Teddy,” Roy laughed, walking toward
the two girls. “Don’t mind him. He
gets that way every once in a while, but he’s
harmless. How are you, Nell and Ethel? We
brought our little sister over to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little!” Belle laughed scornfully. “I’m
almost as big as you are, Roy Manley! And I
can shoot almost as well as you can, too! Oh,
Nell, what a lovely dress! Where <span class='it'>did</span> you get
it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Belle and the two boys had removed
some of the stains of travel, they all gathered
in the dining room for lunch. Belle said that
they had had some sandwiches on the way, but
Teddy quickly explained that they were <span class='it'>very
small</span>, and, anyway, one couldn’t live on sandwiches.
And, with this excuse for the coming
slaughter, he and Roy proceeded to “go to
work” on the very excellent food before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the afternoon, while the girls were resting,
the two boys wandered over toward the
bunk-house to talk to Bug Eye, who was detailed
to make out a list of the things needed
on the ranch before the fall round-up. He was
busily engaged when the brothers entered, and
paused with his pencil to the paper and looked
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say,” he began, “is ‘saddle’ spelt ‘a-l’ or
‘e-l’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ‘X’ is silent, like in fish,” Teddy replied.
“What are you doing, Bug Eye? Writing
notes to the cows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not any,” came from the puncher, as he
stretched and yawned widely. “The boss has
got me to figerin’ out how much stuff we lost
durin’ the summer an’ how much we need.
Some job! Rather be punchin’ dogies any
day. Say, what you boys been doin’ with yoreselves?
Hear any more about that gang from
Hawley? Nick Looker told me about the note
you got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy flung one leg over the table Bug Eye
was writing on, and glanced idly at the piece
of paper scribbed over with figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The jail in Hawley was cleaned out,” he
said slowly. “You knew about that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! You don’t say!” Surprise was written
on Bug Eye’s face. “You mean to tell me
them rustlers are loose again, after all the
trouble we had to round ’em up? Great
snakes! How’d that happen, an’ when?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other day,” Teddy answered, watching
his brother closely. Roy seemed intent on
the paper spread on the table before him.
“The sheriff and his deputies were chasing
some would-be gunmen out of town, and when
they came back the prisoners were gone. Probably
away on a week-end visit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what do you know about that?” Bug
Eye shook his head. “Froud, too? He gone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite,” Teddy replied, and told of
Froud’s removal to another jail before the delivery.
“So he’s still sittin’ out of the sun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Bug Eye!” Roy exclaimed suddenly,
“you got that wrong.” He pointed to the
paper. “That should be a capital R. If Mr.
Ball is going to see this paper, you might as
well have it right. See? Make that a capital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore,” Bug Eye replied, and laboriously
effected the correction. Roy watched him carefully.
“Thanks, Roy. Guess that kind of
slipped by me. How long you boys goin’ to
stay with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy answered, and the conversation came
to a close when Roy suggested that they were
interrupting the puncher’s work. The two
boys wandered back toward the ranch house.
The moment they were out of hearing of Bug
Eye, Teddy asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Roy, what was the big idea? You
were watching that paper Bug Eye was writing
on pretty closely. And rawhide doesn’t start
with a capital R. How come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a little plan of my own,” Roy replied
vaguely. “That note, you know. Signed
Reltsur. I thought maybe—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Bug Eye wrote it?” Teddy inquired
in an incredulous voice. “Well, for the love
of Pete, what ever put that into your head?
Bug Eye do a thing like that? Not on your
life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it now,” Roy said shortly. “I don’t
know why I suspected him. Just one of those
crazy ideas you get, I guess. That capital R
seemed to stick in my mind. Come on, I think
Belle and the two girls are around somewhere.
Let’s go and see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy shook his head slowly and followed
his brother. What was getting into Roy?
Thinking Bug Eye wrote that note! Why, Bug
Eye didn’t ride slouched in the saddle! He
forked a bronc like any other puncher in those
parts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, a few days before, Roy had mentioned
seeing the slouched rider directly after the
landslide when he was searching for Teddy.
As though the strange puncher could have had
anything to do with that slide! Yes, Roy was
sure acting queer lately. As far as Teddy
could see, there was no reason for immediate
worry. Even if the rustlers were out of jail
and determined on revenge, they might be forestalled
by guarding the cattle well. True, his
father had declared he thought the thieves
might try other tactics. But, after all, what
could they do? Suppose they had some real
gunmen in their crowd? They would scarcely
take to shooting a man in the back as he rode
along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The note had said the charge against the
rustlers must not be pressed. Well, they were
out of jail now, and, as Mr. Manley had said,
what more did they want? Why should they
bother to avenge themselves on men who had
only protected their own cattle? It didn’t
seem reasonable. Yet, Teddy thought, his
father <span class='it'>was</span> worried. Perhaps he knew more
than he had told. Teddy had never known his
father to show worry unless there was good
reason for it. If he went to town carrying a
gun, a thing he had not done for years except
the time he was actually running down the
horse thieves, he must anticipate trouble of
some sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy shrugged his shoulders and gave up
the problem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two boys found Nell and Ethel showing
Belle some new flowers that had lately come up.
As Teddy and Roy approached the girls turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want soma nice, fresh hunyons?” Ethel
called out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope,” Teddy returned, grinning. “Taka
some strumberries, you got. What’s this, a
garden party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tour of investigation,” Nell answered.
“Oh, Roy, I want to show you these sunflowers!
Aren’t they beautiful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell a maverick!” Roy answered, and,
as Nell looked up, she saw that he was staring
at her instead of at the sunflowers. She
blushed, and bent quickly over to examine
closely some wild roses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time passed pleasantly, and dinner was
soon announced. Roy lingered at the door
watching the sunset, which was especially
brilliant to-night, until Teddy and Belle each
took an arm and pulled him in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But just look at those colors!” he persisted.
“Why, no artist could paint them! They look
like—like flames from a forest fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” Teddy said, grinning at Ethel. “Or
maybe like a ripe tomato smashed against a
white wall. Come on in and eat, you old
dreamer. I’m hungry. Then you can tell
Nell how much the landslide looked like the
volcano scene in the ‘Fall of Pompeii.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy made a friendly pass at his brother, who
ducked, and the two entered and seated themselves
at the table, which was decorated with
flowers in honor of their visit, and it was not
long before the beauty of sunsets was forgotten
in the enjoyment of rare roast beef, carrots,
and mashed potatoes.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span><h1>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>A Man in the Corral</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>At nine o’clock that evening the boys started
for home. Roy had half-heartedly suggested
leaving earlier, but he was overruled. So it
was not until the moon was well above the
horizon that the two young ranchers got away.
Belle was to stay at the 8 X 8 for a few days,
after which Roy and Teddy were to come for
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good-byes were said, and the boys started.
As the car rolled toward home, Teddy, who
was driving, sang softly under his breath.
Roy was content to sit quietly and observe the
splendor of the prairie night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white moonlight painted the ground with
an almost phosphorescent glow. On either side
of the road quakermasts reared their heads,
like tall, gaunt giants. Now and then would
come the cry of some animal in the distance,
weirdly human. The hills ahead seemed to be
crouched in attitudes of slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy squirmed in his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Itch,” he declared briefly, as Roy looked at
him. “Flea, maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens!” Roy groaned. “On a
night like this, you talk about itches and fleas!
Man! where is your appreciation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My what? Oh, my appreciation. Got it
sewed up in my pocket, where I won’t lose
it. Say, Roy, you reckon that bunch that
vamoosed from Hawley will really start something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hope not.” A frown crossed the boy’s face.
“You know what a cattle war means in this
country. Well, it seems to me those birds are
laboring under the impression that they have
something on us, and they think it’s all right
to injure dad if that will square their account
with the X Bar X. Doesn’t make any difference
to them that they’re outlaws. They figure the
country owes them a living, I guess, and
they’ll take it by force if they can’t get it for
nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence for a few moments before
Teddy said slowly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re hanging around this section, and
it’s up to us to watch out. Forewarned is
forearmed, you know. Golly! That moon is so
bright I’ll bet I could run without any glims.
Look—” He switched off the headlights for a
moment. The road stretched before him like
a silvered path. Each rut and depression in it
was clearly defined, so that Teddy had no
trouble in guiding the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better turn ’em on again,” Roy suggested,
after a minute. “If the moon should slide
under a cloud you’d be ditched in a second. I
wonder—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just at that moment the very thing Roy had
anticipated came to pass. The silvery glow
was cut off as suddenly as a flashlight that is
switched out. The wind, blowing at a fair rate
of speed, had tossed a cloud between the
prairie and the moon. Roy gave a yell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jam on the brakes! Never mind the
lights! Stop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy obeyed, and with a screeching of
brakebands the car came to a halt. Then
Teddy threw the lights on once more. The
front of the car was nearly off the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good thing the brakes held,” Teddy remarked,
grinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell a maverick it is!” Roy retorted.
“I suppose you just wanted to try ’em out,
hey? After this you’d better leave the lights
on, unless you want to haul this boiler out of
a ditch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir!” Teddy answered, with mock
humility. “Anything you say, sir. We strive
to please. Say—” He stopped and lowered his
voice. “Listen! You hear anything?” He
reached forward and turned off the ignition
switch, killing the motor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment both boys sat in silence. The
face of the moon was still clouded, so that darkness
surrounded them. Then, in the distance,
the boys heard the sound of a horseman—clickety-click,
clickety-click, clickety-click—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a hurry,” Roy said wonderingly.
“Seems to be coming this way, too. Well—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hitched his left shoulder a trifle and
brought his pistol forward. Teddy did the
same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we wait?” Teddy asked, glancing
back and striving to pierce the blackness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s not. If he wants us, he knows where
to find us. Though the chances are it’s only
one of the men from the 8 X 8. Anyway, it’s
none of our business. Come along—step on
it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy started the motor again, and the car
proceeded. As the moon lit the landscape with
its beams once more, Roy turned and glanced
back. But the road curved just here, and he
could see no rider. Also, they could no longer
hear the hoofbeats, which, if they were approaching,
should have become louder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s something else to worry about,”
Teddy said, with a grin. “Funny that we both
took it for granted that whoever it was must
be on <span class='it'>our</span> trail! We seem to be getting sillier
every day. At least I do. Like this afternoon,
when we had that snake scare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forget it,” Roy advised. “You were no
worse than I was. I heard a noise—and I
would have sworn it was a side-winder. So
we’re both in the same boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they neared home, both boys were wondering
about the rider they had heard from
afar. Neither would admit this, afraid of being
accused of nervousness, but, nevertheless,
when they came in sight of the corral of the X
Bar X, they glanced cautiously about the place
before riding in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy made a complete circle of the ranch
yard, looking keenly about. Roy did not remark
on this strange behavior. As they
neared the entrance to the yard for the second
time, Roy stretched and yawned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s hit the hay,” he suggested, letting
his arms drop to his sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suits me,” Teddy agreed. Then: “Kind of
quiet here to-night; don’t you think so, Roy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you expect, a brass band?” his
brother grinned. “Golly, Teddy, you don’t
mean to say it’s getting you, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is what getting me?” the other countered,
though he knew well enough what Roy meant.
He guided the car toward the garage. “What
do you mean, Roy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That note,” his brother responded laconically.
“And the horseman we heard—but
didn’t see. And the puncher who rides leaning
to the left in the saddle. And the whole
blamed, silly business! How about it—am I
talking straight or shall I elucidate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy climbed stiffly out of the driver’s
seat and walked toward the large doors of the
auto shed. Halfway there he turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I get you,” the boy said shortly. “Roy,
you’re right. I’ve been thinking. These
things that are happening, though they seem
small and insignificant, all mean something.
I’ll lay a bet on that.” He stopped and mused
for a moment. “It’s hard to explain, but I
feel as though some one or something were
waiting around to sock me in the neck with a
juicy tomato when my back is turned. And I
don’t like it, by jinks! I don’t like it! Why
don’t they start something? If the rustlers
would show their hand, we’d know what we
were up against. But this waiting, without
knowing what for, is getting me sort of nervous,
I don’t mind saying!” He strode forward,
and flung one of the doors shut savagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy was closing the other, and until the
garage was closed and locked he did not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not the only one who feels that
way,” he then said in a low voice. “I’ve been
thinking those things for the past two or three
days. And let me tell you something—dad has
too. He may not say much, but he’s worried
all the same. He hasn’t quite gotten over the
time we had with that bunch of horse thieves
only a little while ago, and he doesn’t want it
to happen again. That’s why he wanted more
men to ride herd. When he went to Eagles a
few days ago, he toted a gun. You knew
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy grunted affirmatively. The two boys
walked toward the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t have it on to-day, but maybe
he took it off because he didn’t want to worry
mother,” Roy went on. “Dad knows there are
a few men in Eagles that wouldn’t cry if he
disappeared in a sort of general way, like being
shot up. And he’s not going to give them
a gun, butt first—not if I know dad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy nodded. He recalled the look on his
father’s face the other day in the yard, as, with
a savage gesture, he had thrown the mysterious
note to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad certainly seems changed,” Teddy said
slowly. At the steps, leading to the porch of
the house, the boys paused for a moment to
take one last look around. From the corral
came the noise of restless horses, moving about,
rubbing against the bars, now and then neighing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder what’s bothering them,” Roy said,
more to himself than to Teddy. “I suppose
it’s just one of the nights when the cattle want
to be walking around instead of resting. I
notice that happens mostly on nights when the
moon is full. Maybe that has something to do
with it. Jimminy, it sounds like a horse convention
going on. There—that’s Star whinnying—I
could tell him a mile off. I got a good
notion to—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, hit the hay,” Teddy said, with a
laugh. “You want to dream about rustlers all
night? You will, by jinks, if you don’t snap out
of it. Star’s all right. You don’t have to
sing him a lullaby every time he gets insomnia,
you know. Let’s go. Put the hall light out,
will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young ranchers ascended the stairs
softly to their room. In little more than five
minutes both were ready for bed. Roy
switched the light off and crawled under the
covers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out in the corral the horses still moved
restlessly. The figure of a man on foot, pressed
against one of the far posts so as to be out of
sight from the house, seemed to annoy the
ponies greatly.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Nick’s Trick</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after the boys had taken Belle to
the 8 X 8, Nick Looker, seated on the side of
his bunk, was showing the assemblage a new
trick he had lately acquired from a book called
“A Hundred Ways to Amuse Your Friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>About him were grouped several punchers of
the X Bar X, and also Roy and Teddy. Nick
held up his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now the idea, gents, is this,” he intoned.
“I’m goin’ to tear a dollar bill in ten pieces,
then roll ’em up in this here handkerchief, and
in a second—blooey! The dollar bill is whole
an’ entire and in as excellent a condition as before
the demonstration—that means trick, Gus.
Now watch me closely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached in his pocket. The punchers
leaned forward eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Nick—forget how to do
it?” Pop asked after a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t find a bill,” Nick answered shortly.
“Thought sure I had one. Any of you birds
got a dollar he’ll lend me for a minute?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! To tear up?” Rad Sell demanded.
“Not me! Think I’m crazy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only a trick, you galoot!” Nick exclaimed
disgustedly. “You’ll get your bill
back, don’t worry about that. Think I want
to keep it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t be surprised,” Pop Burns said,
in a matter-of-fact, calm voice. “I’ve known
stranger things to happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy nudged Roy, and they both grinned.
This might prove interesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, come on, come on!” Nick shouted
impatiently. “If you guys want to see the trick—an’
it’s a mighty good one, too—you got to
get me a bill. Come on, fork over! Don’t be
so tight! I won’t hurt your old bill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe none of ’em ain’t got one, Nick,”
suggested Pop mildly. “Me, I ain’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought you said you was goin’ to rip it in
ten pieces?” came from Nat Raymond, in a
curious tone. “How about that, Nick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sufferin’ snakes, but you waddies are
dumb! That’s part of the trick—then I make
the pieces come together again and the bill is
as good as new! Hoppin’ lizards, if I was as
thick as you guys—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have to have a one dollar bill?” Gus
Tripp interrupted. “I got a ten here, but I
sure hate to part with it. If anything should
happen—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothin’ will happen,” Nick growled.
“Sure, the ten is all right. Let’s have it, Gus.
I’ll give it back in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly Gus passed the bill over. With a
sudden motion he brought it to his lips, and
sighed deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back to yore papa,” he murmured.
“An’ don’t do no wanderin’ around! Nick,
take care of my baby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This’ll be good,” Teddy whispered to his
brother. “Look at Pop! He’s sure interested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick nonchalantly took the proffered bill.
He looked at it carefully. Then he took a handkerchief
from his pocket and held it up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This, ladies an’—I mean gents, is the handkerchief.
An’ here we have the bill, which I
shall proceed to rip into ten pieces, each of
equal length an’—an’ something. I wish for
you to examine both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed the bill to Pop Burns and the
cloth to Nat Raymond. “Look at ’em, boys,
to see that there is no fake. Pop, note the
serial numbers on to that there bill, so you
will see that no substitution is to take place
nowheres. Take yore time, gents, take yore
time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ this is the bill yore goin’ to rip?” Pop
asked, turning it over in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The every same bill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s see the handkerchief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nat passed it over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ yore goin’ to put the pieces of the bill
in this here cloth an’ make ’em come together
again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what I’m a-goin’ to do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pop looked down at the bill again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ yore goin’ to rip this here bill in ten
pieces, you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am—each of equal length.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This bill right here, hey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That same bill!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pop held the ten dollar bill up to the light
of one of the windows. Then, suddenly, he tore
it squarely across the middle, and, before any
one could stop him, he tore it again, and again,
until all that remained of Gus’s “baby” were
ten green strips of paper, all of equal length.
These Pop handed to Nick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” he said with satisfaction. “They’re
all tore fer you. Let’s see you do the trick.”
The veteran puncher’s eyes were alight with
anticipation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick looked dully at the pieces of what was
once a certificate entitling the holder to ten
dollars in gold at the United States Treasury.
He seemed stunned. One of the strips fell
from the palm of his hand and floated slowly
to the floor. Then Nick awoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You crazy old coot!” he yelled. “You tore
Gus’s ten-spot all up! You ruined it! What
was the idea, hey? What was the idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t that what you wanted done?” Pop
asked innocently, a frown of perplexity coming
over his face. “You said you were goin’ to
tear it up, Nick—you know you did! Didn’t he,
fellers? You all heard him—didn’t he say he
was goin’ to rip it up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea, but <span class='it'>I</span> had to do it!” Nick raved. “Not
you! Snakes, I can’t do nothin’ now! The
bill’s ripped, Gus! She’s spoiled!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean to say you can’t do the trick?”
Gus asked incredulously, staring at the remains
of his bill. “Roll ’em in the handkerchief,
Nick, an’ make ’em come together again! You
got to! That’s all the jack I got in the world
an’ pay-day a week off! Roll ’em up, Nick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jumpin’ lizards, what good’ll rollin’ ’em
do?” demanded Nick, a look of disgust on his
face. “Course I can’t do the trick now! Ask
Pop to do it—maybe he knows how! He tore
it up on you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me do it?” the veteran seemed mildly surprised.
“Why, Nick, it’s yore trick! I can’t
do no tricks! Go on, roll them pieces up an
make ’em come out together. You can do it.
Don’t give up so soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you the trick is ruined!” Nick cried
frantically. “I’m finished! I won’t have
nothin’ more to do with it! I’m through!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a second!” Gus stepped forward.
“How about my ten-spot, Nick? Where’s
that? I gave it to you. Ain’t you goin’ to roll
it up and give it back to me? Golly, Nick, you
can take a crack at it anyhow, can’t you? Maybe
she’ll work. You never know till you try.
Go ahead, Nick—roll ’em up! I sure need that
tenner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick threw his arms about wildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yore all cookoo! I can’t do the trick now!
Me, I had to rip the bill up, nobody else! That
was part of the trick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what difference does it make who tore
it?” Pop inquired anxiously. “She’s tore,
ain’t she? That’s what you wanted. An’
here’s the handkerchief. Put the pieces in it,
Nick, an’ say ‘blooey’, or whatever it is you
say, to make ’em come together again. Then
you can give the tenner back to Gus. You
want to see the trick done, don’t you, Gus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sure do!” was the positive answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick looked from one to the other in despair.
On the faces of all but Pop and Gus were wide
grins. This was something they hadn’t counted
on, and the boys were enjoying the situation to
its full extent. Roy and Teddy were chuckling
with glee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick glanced down once more at the remnants
of the bill. Slowly he shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess it’s on me,” he said sadly. “Gus,
I owe you ten. But by golly, it was Pop’s fault!
He ought to pay you, by rights. But I’ll stick
to my word. I’ll give you the tenner to-morrow,
Gus.” He reached out to take the
handkerchief from Pop. He was too mad to
suggest, or even think of, pasting the parts
of the bill together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you can’t do it, hey?” the old rancher
demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope! No can do. Here, take these for a
souvenir, Pop. You deserve ’em.” And Nick
laughed bitterly as he dropped the pieces of the
bill into Pop’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the puncher stared at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You was goin’ to roll ’em in this handkerchief
an’ then they’d be O.K., wasn’t you?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea, I <span class='it'>was</span>,” Nick replied sardonically.
“But the show’s closed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all you had to do—just roll ’em up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all,” and Nick laughed again,
harshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that seems easy. If you could do it,
don’t see why I can’t. Now let’s see. I put
’em in this way, an’ fold the cloth. Then
what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick did not answer. He strolled toward the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, Nick! what do I do now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make soup out of ’em,” came the answer
over Nick’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, wait, Nick! Maybe it’ll work! Stick
around fer a second, will yuh? Maybe I can do
it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea, an’ maybe cows can fly, too,” Nick
snorted. But he turned, nevertheless, with a
desire to see Pop’s failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carefully the old man rolled the handkerchief
containing the pieces of the bill into a small
ball. This he held in the palm of his hand
for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, she ought to work,” he stated doubtfully.
With a flip of his wrist he sent the handkerchief
flying open. From its folds fluttered
not the torn pieces he had put in, but—a ten
dollar bill, whole and entire!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick’s eyes almost bulged from their sockets.
Amazement was written large on his face. He
leaned forward, breathing hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There she is!” Pop shouted triumphantly.
“Told you it ’ud work! All it needed was
somebody to do it! Gus, there’s yore tenner
as good as new. Nick, yore a poluka. That’s
as easy as pie! She came right out, as easy as
easy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick turned his head slowly, looking at Pop
with awe. He blinked rapidly. Then, without
a word, he stumbled to the door and disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gus bent down and picked up his bill, a wide
grin on his face. He bowed to Pop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From one artist to another—greetings,”
he snickered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pop returned the bow. Then, reaching for
his back pocket, he drew out a thin volume.
Silently he held it up, so that Roy and Teddy
could read the name on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Found it in Nick’s foot-locker,” he said
simply. “Makes right interestin’ readin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy and Roy bent forward. Then, as they
read the title, a roar of laughter burst from
each. Long and loudly they laughed, for on the
cover of the book were the words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Hundred Ways to Amuse Your Friends.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>The Girls Are Gone</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>On Friday, the day that Teddy and Roy
were to ride to the 8 X 8 for Belle and bring
her home, a squadron of black, low-hung clouds
marched over the mountains and began to discharge
their ammunition of rain toward a
thirsty earth. They were seemingly well
stocked, for they held their position for three
days, until, on the morning of the fourth, the
sun dispersed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the storm, the business of the ranch
had practically come to a standstill, for there
was little that could be done in wet weather.
Besides that, the time before a fall round-up is
always slack, the punchers spending most of
their days repairing their outfits and doing odd
jobs about the yard and the corral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick Looker wasted many hours in deep
thought over the trick Pop had played on him.
Of course he found that his book had been
taken from his foot-locker, but even then he remained
somewhat in the dark. He simply could
not fathom how Pop had turned the joke so
cleverly. He took Roy and Teddy into his confidence,
and they listened with grave faces to
his tale of woe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Pop was a clever scout, or something
like that, I could understand it,” Nick confessed.
“But he’s such a dumb galoot! I can’t
figure it nohow! There he stands, with a look
on his map as innercent as a white-faced yearling,
an’ I walk right into his hands! Then he
turns around an’ gives me the royal razz. No
sir, it’s beyond me! Oh, I can guess how he
did the trick all right, after he saw how in that
book of mine. That ain’t what’s worryin’ me.
What I want to know is how he planned the
whole busted business an’ was Gus in with
him. By golly, she’s too many fer me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two brothers, restraining their laughter,
admitted they could not solve the problem for
him, and, shaking his head, Nick walked away.
It was many days before he could hear a laugh
without staring with a suspicious scowl at the
merry one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind was strong at times and one extra
heavy gust blew down several of the poles upon
which the telephone wire was fastened. As a
consequence, the phone was out of commission
for several days. At the time nobody thought
anything of this, for the local line was none
too good and often went out of commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although during the rain Roy and Teddy did
no range riding, except one afternoon when the
sun shone for a few hours, promising clear
weather, only to disappear behind clouds again
by evening, yet they were not idle. Together
with their father, they went over all possible
places the escaped rustlers might try to raid
the herd and steal cattle, planning to fortify
the weak spots against possible depredations.
There were now five men riding herd, and Mr.
Manley seriously considered adding another,
but after a consultation with the boys, decided
against it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t have ’em all out,” he declared. “If
that ‘Reltsur’ starts anything around the
ranch, we don’t want to be handicapped by lack
of men. This time there’ll be none of this ‘man
to man’ stuff. I want no more trouble with
that gang of hoss thieves, an’ I’ll let them
alone if they’ll stay their distance. But if they
want to mix it—” and the man’s eyes narrowed—“they’ll
get what they’re lookin’ for!
At the first sign of trouble we ride ’em down,
an’ polish ’em off, if we have to. The sooner
they learn that the new West has no place for
rustlers an’ gunmen, the better. In the old
days—” He hesitated, and a smile trembled on
his lips, but instantly his face grew grave
again. “They’re gone forever. We have no
more time for chasin’ hoss thieves all over the
landscape. Besides, the men were different
then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suppose Gilly Froud would last a
minute around a gang like Whitey Kunkle an’
Mike Delnegro an’ Lasher Pete? Huh! he’d
be run off the reservation. Those waddies may
have been tough, but they weren’t cowards an’
wouldn’t plug a man without givin’ him a
chance to go fer his shootin’ iron. But these
birds!” His eyes flickered with contempt.
“Why, they ain’t even tough! They’re just a
bunch of sore-heads, afraid to take a man on
unless he’s tied hand an’ foot and him in the
light while they’re shootin’ from the dark! A
fine gang! Sendin’ a note sayin’ I’d get mine
if I didn’t lay off ’em!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let ’em come! Maybe when the lazy
cowards find out they can’t blaze away from
behind a brick wall or a barroom window, they’ll
change their minds about thinkin’ they’re bold,
bad cattle rustlers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the longest speech the boss had
made in many a moon. But it indicated his
feelings in the matter, and left no doubt as to
his intentions if “Reltsur” tried to make good
his threat. Mr. Manley never looked for
trouble, nor, indeed, did he meet it half way. It
had to come up to his door and knock if it
wanted to see him; but once it did that, the
vicinity would not complain of lack of excitement
for some time to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only natural that his two sons should
inherit some of this steady, determined disposition
of his, and Teddy and Roy had it in full
measure. Still, Roy’s was tempered with much
of the gentleness of his mother, and, like her,
he met the world with grave, understanding
eyes. While he shared, in a measure, Teddy’s
wholehearted appreciation of a bit of horseplay,
yet frequently he would see behind outward
appearances and discover things which
were lost to his brother’s more superficial
glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, in the situation existing at the X Bar X
Teddy himself found plenty of food for
thought. His father had taken the warning
signed “Reltsur” with a great deal more gravity
than the younger boy had thought he would.
This, in itself, was enough to convince Teddy
that the matter could not be laughed off. To
add to this, the several happenings before and
after the visit of the night rider, while none of
them significant in themselves, yet totaled into
an aspect calling for consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lone horseman on Mica Mountain, the
day of the slide, who rode with that slouch so
reminiscent of another puncher. The delivery
of the note. The escape of the rustlers from
jail. The hoofbeats behind the car as the boys
rode home from the 8 X 8. And, had they but
known it, the figure lurking near the corral on
that same bright moonlight night when the
horses neighed and moved restlessly. All this
presaged something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucky that Froud, at least, was out of the
way. Then a sudden thought struck Teddy,
and he chuckled. Perhaps it was lucky for
Froud, too, that he was safe in jail! Just before
his capture he had knifed the head of the
band of rustlers of which he was a member, so
that he might take the leader’s place and thus
get a larger share of the booty for himself. He
had left the man for dead, but, with a desperate
effort, the leader, who named himself
Brand, which was particularly appropriate,
finally reached a cabin where Teddy and Roy
had taken shelter from a storm. They had
bound up Brand’s wounds and later, out of
thankfulness for their services, he had told
them of a plan the rustlers had made to steal
the cattle of the X Bar X. Then he left—left,
possibly, to hunt Froud, who had knifed
him. Thus it was well for Froud that he was
still in safety behind prison bars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy’s mind was revolving these thoughts
during the time that the rain beat down upon
the range, converting it into an ocean of mist,
with the mountains sticking their heads out
like the tall masts of ships. But at last a brisk
wind arose, the clouds were blown away, and
the sun greeted the dripping trees with a warm
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That afternoon Mrs. Manley asked Roy and
Teddy to take a car to Peter Ball’s place and
bring Belle home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid she may have outstayed her
welcome already,” their mother added, with a
smile. “She may want to bring Nell and Ethel
back with her. I don’t suppose you boys will
object?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, not very loudly, Mom,” Teddy answered,
with a laugh. “I know Roy won’t,
anyhow. I caught him using a rhyming dictionary
the other day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like fun you did!” his brother retorted,
his face fiery red. “That was just an ordinary,
plain, every-day dictionary! Where do you
get that stuff—‘rhyming dictionary’? What
would I do with a rhyming dictionary? What
would be the sense of it? I don’t even know
how to use one—that is, not very well. And,
anyway, that wasn’t one! It was—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoa, baby! Tighten up that cinch-strap—you’re
slipping! Wow! Listen to him,
Mom! He’s going to be a politician! I can
tell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it wasn’t a rhyming dictionary,” Roy
grumbled, laughing a little. “And you’d better
take a look at the car, Teddy. We don’t
want another puncture or another scare like—like—that
landslide,” he finished quickly.
“What time shall we start, Mom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Manley wanted them to leave as soon
as possible, so they might get back before dark;
so, making sure the auto was filled with gas
and oil, they began their journey. After the
storm, the air was cool and invigorating, and,
as they rode along, Roy explained the theory
of “low pressure areas” until Teddy remarked
that he thought an area was a song from an
opera. It took a minute for this to penetrate,
but when it did Roy snorted in disgust and
refused to say another word until Teddy hit an
especially large bump, sending Roy flying toward
the top of the car. Even then Roy’s description
of Teddy’s driving had very little to
do with opera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder what the girls did during all that
rainy weather,” Teddy remarked, as they
neared the 8 X 8.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curly was probably writing letters to you,
which she forgot to send,” Roy responded, with
a grin. “Aside from that, I guess they talked.
Somehow, girls seem to do that especially
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think Nell and Ethel will come back with
Belle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Golly, you sure seem positive about it.
How do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got a hunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy drove on in silence for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’ll you bet they won’t be at home
when we get there?” he said finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean—that they’ll be out riding?
Well, we can wait. Bug Eye will probably
be there, an’ we can bat the sock with him
for a while. Jimminy, I don’t know what made
me think he could have written that note—and
him the one who helped us capture the rustlers,
too! Well, we live and learn. I guess,
after all, that message was just to scare us.
Nothing will come of it. The rustlers are
probably miles away from here by now, heading
for Mexico. Chances are we’ll never hear
of them again. Come on, step on it. Mother
said she wanted us back before dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he depressed the accelerator, Teddy stole
a look at his brother. Roy had expressed the
very opposite of his former declarations! Did
he really think the horse thieves had abandoned
their plans for revenge? Well, maybe
so. It seemed likely, now that all this time
had passed without any sign of them. Teddy
sank more deeply in the seat. If Roy wasn’t
worrying, certainly he should not!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A quarter of an hour more and they reached
the yard of the 8 X 8. As Teddy and Roy
alighted, they noticed that there was no sign of
activity about the place. The yard was deserted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Told you they’d be out,” Teddy asserted,
as the boys walked toward the door of the ranch
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Riding, most likely. Guess Mrs. Ball is in,
though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy rang the doorbell and waited. In a
moment the door opened, and a large, jolly-faced
woman greeted them with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, come in!” she said, beaming on
them. “Glad you boys came over. Bug-Eye
was saying only the other day that he wanted
to ask you about a new kind of carburetor.
Pete is out, but if you’ll sit down I’ll get you
some milk and sandwiches. Guess you can
eat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right the first time, Mrs. Ball,” Roy answered,
with a grin. “But don’t go to any
trouble. We’ve got to start right back—as
soon as sis and Nell and Ethel are ready.
They’re out riding, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A puzzled look came over Mrs. Ball’s face.
She hesitated when halfway to the door, and
turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, out riding?” she asked,
curiously. “They’re at your place, aren’t
they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At our place!” Teddy echoed. He paled
slightly. “I’m—I’m afraid I don’t understand
you, Mrs. Ball. Why should they be at our
place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you sent for them! You don’t mean
to say—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s get this straight, Mrs. Ball,” Roy
said slowly. His voice trembled just a little.
“Aren’t Belle and Ethel and Nell here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course not! Oh, what can have
happened? Oh, my gracious! I don’t know
what I’m doing! I’m so turned around! Why,
a man came Saturday in an auto with a note
from your mother, saying he was to take the
girls with him—the three of them! And they
went, Belle, Ethel, and Nell—they went with
him! Why, I thought he was from your place!
Oh, my lands! what can have happened? The
three girls—they’re gone—they’re gone!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>An Ultimatum</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>Just outside the house a whistle sounded.
Neither Roy nor Teddy heard it. They stood
facing Mrs. Ball, their faces a sickly white beneath
their tan. Slowly Teddy’s hands
clenched until his nails dug into his palms. Roy
took a quick breath, which sounded like a gasp
in the silence of that room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Ball swayed slightly, and Roy took a
swift step forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s—it’s all right,” he said uncertainly.
“Don’t—get excited. I think—I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone!” The word seemed wrung from the
woman’s bloodless lips. “Belle—Ethel—Nell—gone!
I tell you they’re gone! Where—where—they’re
gone—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seemed about to faint, and Teddy and
Roy sprang to her side. At that moment a
step sounded in the doorway and a man’s voice
boomed a greeting, only to be cut off sharply
as Peter Ball took in the scene with a rapid
glance. When his wife saw him, she came to
herself somewhat and flung herself sobbing into
his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Pete!” she moaned, “something terrible
has happened. The girls—our nieces—and
Belle Ada—who were here—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, now, Sera, just take things easy,”
Mr. Ball soothed. He looked quickly at Roy
and Teddy, a frantic question in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Mr. Ball,” Teddy stammered,
“we thought Belle and the other girls were still
here, and we came over to get them and Mrs.
Ball told us that they had left for our place on
Saturday with a man who had a note—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to say he wasn’t one of your
father’s men?” Mr. Ball demanded, holding his
wife close and staring incredulously at the
boys. “Why, he had a note from your mother!
Sera—Sera—” He looked down at his wife.
“Where is that note? Have you got it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s—it’s upstairs,” Mrs. Ball murmured,
her voice choked with tears. Suddenly she
straightened, and, with a determined motion,
drew her hands over her eyes. “Wait here—I’ll
get it,” and she hurried toward the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy fingered his hat uncertainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what to say, Mr. Ball,” he
muttered. “We haven’t heard from the girls
and we thought they were still here. I can’t
imagine—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy gave a short laugh, and his brother
and Mr. Ball turned to him in surprise. Then
they saw that he was staring fixedly at
the wall, a strained look on his face. The
laugh had come from between clenched teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got an idea,” Teddy said slowly.
“I’ve got a hunch—and—and if it’s true, I’ll—”
Suddenly he raised both hands and
shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pull a rotten trick like that, will you? The
dirty thieves! Kidnappers! Girl stealers!
We’ll get ours, will we? Not this time! Reltsur!
I know—I know—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teddy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy seized his brother’s arm in a grip of
steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teddy, stop it! Teddy! Snap out of it
now! You don’t know anything! You’re just
guessing! Stop that yelling!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy put his hand to his head. For a moment
he shook as though with the ague, then
took a deep breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” he muttered. “I—I didn’t
mean to shout. Didn’t know what I was doing,
I guess. Don’t mind me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ball stepped forward and laid a friendly
hand on the boy’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know just how you feel, son,” he said
kindly. “But don’t get worked up. The girls
may be all right. It may be just a joke, or—or
something. Take it easy, son. When my
wife comes down— Did you get it, Sera?” he
broke off eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently his wife handed him a slip of paper.
Mr. Ball glanced at it and passed it to Roy.
Together the two boys stared at the writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was short and addressed to Mrs. Peter
Ball. It ran:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“This will introduce Jack Richmond, who is
driving for us now. He has come to bring Belle
Ada home. Can’t Nell and Ethel visit with us
for a while? We should love to have them.
They can all pile in the car with Jack, and he’ll
bring them over to our ranch. Please say yes.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>Barbara Havens Manley.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>For a long moment the boys gazed at the
note. Then Teddy reached out and took it
from his brother’s unresisting hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That writing,” he murmured, still with
bent head. “It looks familiar. I’ve seen it
before—” He glanced swiftly up. “Roy! do
you recognize it? That capital R?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy peered at the note again. Then his eyes
narrowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reltsur!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s who! The one who sent the note to
dad! So, that’s his game, is it? Well, he
won’t get far! The dog, I’ll—” Teddy
stopped, breathing hard. He lowered his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate to say it, Mr. Ball, but I think Belle
and the others have been stolen—kidnapped!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shocked silence came over those in the
room. It seemed too incredible. It was not to
be believed that anything like this could happen.
Why, only last week the three girls were
standing in the garden just outside the window.
Belle had picked a wild rose and had twined it
in her lovely black hair. She and Nell and
Ethel had stood there, as the boys approached,
and Ethel had said “Want some nice, fresh—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, in the garden, were the roses. Their
sweet scent drifted in through the open window.
A light breeze sprang up, moving the
screen door, so that the hinges creaked. Out in
the yard a horse whinnied softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter Ball gulped noisily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stolen, hey?” he said in a harsh voice.
“You sure of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This note is written in the same hand that
wrote a warning to dad,” Roy was talking fast.
“Two weeks ago, at night, a rider passed our
bunk-house, where Teddy and I and some of
the boys were standing, and flung us a message
tied to a stick. It said if dad pressed the
charge against the rustlers, who were in jail at
Hawley, he’d get his. Then we heard the rustlers
had escaped. And now this—” He motioned
toward the paper Teddy still held in his
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man who sent the note threatened your
dad?” Mr. Ball demanded, a fierce frown on his
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what,” Teddy answered in a dull
voice. “And it looks like he’d made good, too.
Got us standing flat-footed,” he added bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man who came here was a—a rustler?”
Mrs. Ball gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Sera, just take it easy,” Mr. Ball
boomed. He patted his wife’s shoulder awkwardly.
“Suppose you have a lie-down on the
couch for a while? Remember what the doctor
said about your heart. Boys, you and I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t lie down!” Mrs. Ball exclaimed,
her face flushed. “I’m going after those kidnappers,
that’s what I’m going to do! Pete,
you get me a gun! No man is going to steal
three girls right from under my nose—not while
I’m healthy! You just forget about my heart!
It’s as good as it ever was! I guess I haven’t
lived in the West all my life for nothing! I
guess I haven’t forgotten how to shoot, either!
Pete, I’m going to ride with you!” She pushed
back a loose strand of hair and stood gasping
for breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete Ball shook his head slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Sera,” he said gently. “I’m afraid
not. I know how much you want to, but some
one has got to stay here and take charge of
things. You can do more to help in that way
than any other. It’s just possible that the
girls might escape and make their way back
here. You see what I mean, don’t you, Sera?”
He looked at her anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a moment Mrs. Ball nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess you’re right, Pete,” she said
heavily. “I was crazy to think you could be
bothered with a woman along. But when I
think of Nell, Ethel and Belle being taken by
that bunch of gunmen to heaven knows where,
I—I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she stopped and walked over to her
husband. She rested her hands on his shoulders
and looked in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pete,” she said in a low voice, “listen to
me! You know I love you better than anything
in the world. We’ve been together now for
twenty-six years. We’ve seen this old ranch
grow up from a little cattle farm to a place
we can be proud of. We’ve had lots of hard
times, you and I, and we’ve weathered them all.
I’d rather die myself than have anything happen
to you. But now—” her voice rose, and
took on a vibrant tone—“Pete, bring back
those girls! They were our guests. They were
under our very roof, under our protection, and
I love every one of them like a daughter. If
you have to give your own life to do it, Pete,
bring—back—those—girls!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Off on the Chase</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>Quite simply and unaffectedly, Mr. Ball
kissed his wife on the forehead. He said not a
word, but stood for a moment looking down at
her. Then, motioning to Roy and Teddy, he
made for the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll get ’em,” Roy declared brokenly.
“We’ll get ’em, I vow it! Teddy—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment tears welled up in the older
youth’s eyes, but they were tears of sudden,
violent emotion, and Roy wiped them away,
unashamed. He saw his brother standing in
the center of the room, shoulders drooping, a
dull, leaden look of deep despair on his face.
When Roy touched his arm he started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teddy, let’s be going,” the boy said softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Belle!” Teddy muttered, “Belle gone—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Mrs. Ball saw that her speech had
brought the blow home to the boys with deadening
force. She shook her head sadly and
grasped an arm of each.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buck up!” she exclaimed firmly. “Teddy,
you’re not going to weaken now, are you?
Come on, Pete is waiting for you. I’ll telephone
your folks—the linemen just finished
their work on this section and we can use the
phone again—and send Bug Eye over with
some men to your ranch right away. We’ll be
so hot on the trail of those rustlers they’ll wish
they’d never heard of the West! Why, you’ll
have your sister back within twenty-four
hours! We’ll rake this whole prairie with a
fine tooth comb! We’ll get ’em, no matter
where they hide! You listen to me—I know
what I’m talking about! Look up now and ride
after ’em, boys! Go get ’em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy came to life as though he had touched
a live wire. Then he threw back his shoulders
and his eyes blazed. The blood returned to
his face with a rush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll get ’em!” he exclaimed harshly. “I
don’t care where they hide—they can’t get
away! Roy, let’s go! We’ll ride ’em down,
wherever they are! Good-bye, Mrs. Ball—don’t
worry! Roy! Come on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys ran across the room. The door
slammed shut behind them. There was a slight
jar as they leaped down the steps. In another
moment the roar of a motor sounded, the cutout
on full. Mrs. Ball rushed to the window,
and saw the auto, with her husband and the
boys in it, speed madly up the road. For a
moment she stood there, watching the cloud of
dust settle as the car disappeared over the hill.
Then she covered her face with her hands and
sobbed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them find them, O Lord! Let them find
them! I haven’t asked for very much up to
now; but please, Lord, let them bring the girls
home safely! Send their sister back to those
two dear boys and my nieces back to me!
Please! Oh, please!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually her sobs subsided. Then, calm-eyed
and determined, she went to the telephone.
Mr. Ball had not misplaced his trust
in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The occupants of the car which was burning
up the road between the X Bar X and the 8 X 8
were, for the most part, silent, sunk deep
within their thoughts. Teddy was driving
automatically, his eyes fixed upon the road, his
mind spinning with tangled ideas. The rustlers
had made good their threat. His father’s
fears had been realized. But in what a fashion!
None of them had anticipated anything like
this! Even now it was hard to realize. That
there could be men in this country who would
stoop to a scoundrel’s trick of this sort! If
they had only had some intimation of what was
about to occur! They had imagined the rustlers
might make trouble of some kind—steal
the cattle or even shoot them down from ambush.
Better, far better, that the whole herd
be killed than this!</p>

<p class='pindent'>What would his father say? And mother!
Teddy blinked his eyes rapidly. Viciously he
pressed the accelerator to the floor and the car
shot ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not wastin’ any time,” Mr. Ball declared,
leaning forward from his seat in the rear.
Teddy shook his head, but did not trust himself
to reply. He was not sure his voice would
be quite steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy turned to Mr. Ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will your wife be all right alone? She
won’t—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a thoroughbred,” Mr. Ball answered
shortly. “After she’s had her little cry she’ll
be as cool and collected as any man. Your
folks will know about it before we get there,
Roy, an’ Mrs. Ball will get our bunch together
an’ send ’em on over. Bet you she’ll remember
to send an extra horse by Bug Eye, too, for me.
She’s a great little woman—a great little
woman—” His voice trailed off into silence,
and once more the three sat staring intently at
the road ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Roy’s mind there came the picture of another
ride taken not so very long ago, in from
Eagles. That was the day their horses had
been stolen and Nell and Ethel had been in the
car with them. Roy remembered how Nell had
exclaimed excitedly when they reached Bitter
Cliff lookout, that high, mountainous point
halfway between the town and their ranch.
Eagerly he had pointed out the 8 X 8, where
the two girls were going to visit. And that had
been but a few short months ago! Now—now—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks like rain,” Teddy said, in a voice so
low Roy scarcely heard him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t tell—” Roy scanned the horizon
with obvious carefulness. “Those clouds
aren’t quite black enough for rain. Guess
we’ve had our share of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if it made any difference! Yet it was
something to talk about, something else than
Belle and Ethel and Nell. Worrying would do
no good. They must keep calm and work coolly
and determinedly, rather than allow the rage in
their hearts to seep through and warp their
judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy glanced at Teddy out of the corner of
his eye. He noticed that the boy’s face was set
in stern lines and that his eyes never wavered
from the road. Small bunches of muscles stood
out just above his jawbone, like solid hickory-nuts.
Teddy was all right. Almost, Roy could
see the cold, silent determination within his
brother’s mind. The anger which possessed
Teddy was a white anger—the kind that drives
men on over all obstacles, oblivious of pain, of
danger, until they have won through. Roy
bent slightly to the left until his shoulder
touched his brother’s. A sort of electric current
passed through the two boys. They were
together, shoulder to shoulder, nothing could
stop them! In that moment Roy knew they
would never rest until the three girls had been
found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the car pulled into the yard of the X
Bar X, Mr. Manley hurried from the house
and came toward it. Silently he held out his
hand to Peter Ball, then, as the boys alighted,
he drew nearer and threw an arm about each
for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Ball telephoned,” he said quietly.
“Glad we got the line mended in time. I’m
having Nick and Gus get the horses ready.
Mrs. Ball said that Bug Eye and four other
men were on their way over with a bronc for
you, Pete. We’ll start right out as soon as
they come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s mother?” Teddy asked quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the house, son. She’s all right. Want
to see her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both boys nodded and walked toward the
steps, while the two men talked together in low
tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys found their mother sitting calmly
by the window. As she saw them she smiled
slightly, and Roy and Teddy drew deep breaths
of relief. They had been afraid—even more
than they would admit to themselves—of how
she would bear up. But her smile told them
they need have no fear. She was true blue, a
real woman of the West. She would face the
trouble with the rest of them and stand her
share of it. Lovingly she kissed her sons and
looked searchingly into their eyes. What she
found there seemed to satisfy her, for she said
gently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father has been waiting for you, boys.
We know all about it—Mrs. Ball telephoned.
Teddy—Roy—it came suddenly, didn’t it? But
we mustn’t worry too much. I know they’re all
right! Somehow, I am sure of it. Nothing will
happen to them. I’ve said a little prayer, and
my Friend hasn’t failed me yet!” she finished
brightly. “Now you must hurry, boys. Put
on heavy clothes—you may have to ride far
and long. I’ll see you before you leave.
There!” and she kissed them again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re—you’re all right, Mother?” Roy
faltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right? Of course I’m all right!” her
eyes expressed well simulated surprise. “Why
shouldn’t I be? We’ll have them back before
to-morrow night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Mrs. Ball said!” Teddy exclaimed,
a light coming into his eyes. “And I
believe we shall, Mother! Dad knows this
country like a book, and so do we. By golly,
we’ll show ’em what chance they have against
a bunch of real Westerners—those New York
sneak thieves, who think they’re bad men!
We’ll track ’em down an’ salivate ’em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” exclaimed Mrs. Manley firmly.
“That’s the way I like to hear my boys talk!
You find them—and—and <span class='it'>salivate</span> them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the boys returned to the yard, a great
weight seemed lifted from their hearts. That
it had fallen to the heart of their mother, they
did not know. Her willing spirit had taken
much of the burden from their souls, embracing
it as her own. How could they know that
it had passed from them to her with their
mother’s kiss!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now they felt confident, sure of success.
Their steps were firm, their hands steady. And
as their father saw them, he sensed the wonder
that had been performed and silently
blessed his wife. In that hour she may have
lost her boys, but she had gained two men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of preparations for the start,
Bug Eye and four other men arrived. They
had forced their horses to the limit, and the
ponies stood panting and covered with sweat
in the ranch yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Made good time,” Mr. Manley said to Bug
Eye as the puncher dismounted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had to,” was the grim answer. “When
Mrs. Ball told us what had happened we
saddled up and rushed over here pronto. My
boss around?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talking to Mrs. Manley. He’ll be out in a
minute. Can you start as soon as your broncs
get rested, Bug Eye?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure can,” Bug Eye replied grimly. “An’
we’re not holdin’ back any, either. What’s the
plan, Mr. Manley?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before answering, Mr. Manley called his men
around him. Mr. Ball had come out of the
ranch house and was standing with the rest.
Of the X Bar X men there were Nick Looker,
Pop Burns, Gus Tripp and Nat Raymond, besides,
of course, Mr. Manley and Roy and
Teddy. Thus, with the four men who had ridden
over from the 8 X 8 with Bug Eye, there
was quite an assemblage in the yard, waiting
for Mr. Manley to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held up his hand, and the talk died down.
The men leaned forward eagerly. They sensed
from Mr. Manley’s face that a serious moment
was at hand. All of them had heard something
of what had happened, yet they anxiously
awaited the orders of the boss of the X Bar X
Ranch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys,” Mr. Manley began, “this ain’t goin’
to be much of a speech. I don’t feel in the
mood for talkin’, an’ I guess you ain’t hankerin’
to stand there listenin’, either. You all
know that my daughter and Nell Willis and
Ethel Carew were stayin’ at the 8 X 8. Last
Saturday a man in an auto comes up to Pete
Ball’s place with a note, sayin’ that he’s to
bring the girls back with him. The note was
signed with my wife’s name.” He paused for
a moment, then went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My wife didn’t send no such letter. This
man took the three girls with him, to bring
them home, as they thought. That was Saturday.
To-day is Monday. We haven’t heard
from the girls since.” Once more he paused,
and his eyes roved over the men about him.
Then he continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess most of you heard about the message
I got a week or so ago, sayin’ I’d get mine
for pushin’ the charge against those rustlers
we rounded up. That note was signed ‘Reltsur,’
and Roy an’ Teddy say the letter Mrs.
Ball got was in the same handwritin’. Those
rustlers are out of jail now—they made a getaway.
Men, it looks bad—it looks <span class='it'>bad</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think that gang of hoss thieves did this
job, boss?” Nick broke in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure seems so, Nick! An’ I’ll lay money
that they did, too! They have it in for me.
An’ I heard they have two or three gunmen
from the East with ’em. Yep, that’s who we’ve
got to look for, men—this guy Reltsur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence for a moment, then a voice
asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say some geezer drove up last Satiday
an’ took three girls away from the 8 X 8, boss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All turned to the speaker. He was one of
the men who had ridden over with Bug Eye, a
new hand, Bug Eye explained later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what,” Mr. Manley answered
sharply. “You know anything about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wall, I’ll tell you what I see,” the man
drawled. “I was ridin’ in toward the 8 X 8
about sundown on Satiday. You see, I don’t
know this country so well, an’ I was sort of
huggin’ the road, so I wouldn’t—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that, man. Spill it—explain
later!” Mr. Ball interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right. Well, as I was sayin’, I was pretty
close to the road. All of a sudden I hears a car
comin’ an’ I thinks I’ll just hang around an’
see who it is. So I jumps my bronco behind
a tree an’ waits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the pause that followed, the forced
breathing of the men could be plainly heard.
All eyes were glued on the puncher, who went
calmly on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty soon I see a car down the road. As
she comes closer, I noticed there were five
people in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five!” Teddy exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep. There were three girls, a man drivin’,
an’ an old woman, who sure looked like a
Mex, sittin’ in the front seat beside him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A woman!” exclaimed Mr. Manley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you speak of this before?”
asked Pete Ball, a bit sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t get no chance, boss,” was the calm
answer. “I been out ridin’ fence ever since
you hired me, which was soon after I rode in
on Satiday. I didn’t hear nothin’ about no
kidnappin’ till jes’ now on th’ way over, an’
then I begun puttin’ two an’ two together.
For all I knowed, them folks in the auto might
’a’ been a picnicin’ party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” agreed Mr. Manley. “But
it’s lucky that you happened to see them, cowboy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope it’ll turn out so. I’d sure have mentioned
it afore if I’d knowed what it meant.
But I was sent for in a hurry to join
what I thought was a bunch jest takin’ after
rustlers, and it wasn’t until I heard the
young ladies mentioned jest now that I remembered
about that crowd in the auto. The
driver, a mean-lookin’ sort of cuss, seemed
in a pronto rush, an’ the old crone was hoverin’
over the girls like a hen with three
chicks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then they must be goin’ to hold Belle and
the others for ransom. Boys, if we have to,
we’ll pay it—but we’ll give them a fight first!
At any rate, I believe the girls are safe for a
while. Go on, man, which way did the car
head?” asked Mr. Manley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, I was just tryin’ to think.
There’s a cut around here somewhere, only I
can’t think of the name of it. Let’s see—somethin’
like Lightnin’ Gorge or—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thunder Canyon?” Teddy broke in
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it! Thunder Canyon! That’s
where they was headed for! An’ they were
sure steppin’ along, too. Thunder Canyon!
That’s the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manley turned to the others. His eyes
were narrowed and his hand rested on the gun
which hung at his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You men get set,” he said tersely. “We
start right away. Each man take rations
enough to last him for three or four days an’
bring plenty of ammunition. We do no more
foolin’ around! From now on we ride them
rustlers till we get ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly every one was astir. Saddles and
guns were looked over carefully and small bags
of flour, bacon, and tea were prepared. The
boys and their father said a fond good-bye to
Mrs. Manley, who, when she heard of the
puncher’s story of the other woman in the
car, felt greatly relieved. After all, the worst
that could happen would be that the rustlers
would hold the girls until Mr. Manley consented
to do their bidding, whatever it might
be. They would never dare to kill three girls
in cold blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last all was in readiness. The party was
mounted, guns showing conspicuously in saddle
holsters, and the men awaited the word to
start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manley ran from the house and vaulted
into the saddle. He looked quickly about him,
to see that all the men were there. Then he
nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he said laconically. “Let’s go!
Head for Thunder Canyon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, boss,” answered Gus Tripp softly,
and the others nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that calm fashion started the ride after
the rustlers. No shouting, no raking of ponies’
sides with spurs to send them into a leaping
run. Just a bunch of punchers riding out of a
ranch yard, as though they were on their way
to a round-up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet within the heart of every man there was
a fierce, unconquerable purpose—to find the
jailbirds and to “polish ’em off.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>An Unexpected Clew</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>The trail to Thunder Canyon lay through a
region noted for its treacherous footings and
short, stubby clumps of mesquit grass that
might conceal a hole just deep enough to break
a pony’s leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swinging from the road, the riders entered
this desolate tract and proceeded up a gentle
slope, dotted here and there with trees burned
almost leafless by summer suns. Here the land
lay pitifully open to the brazen sky, long since
beaten into submission and now venturing only
half-heartedly to produce any protective vegetation.
This was a land of exile, shunned and
avoided by the surrounding territory. It was
a field apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dull haze covered the sun as the punchers
rode stolidly on. Teddy turned to glance at
his brother, who was loping along in the rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Making the grade, Roy?” he called, and
threw his head slightly to one side. Roy correctly
interpreted the motion, and urged his
pony until he was close to Teddy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did that story we heard strike you?”
Teddy asked, looking about him to see that no
one was listening. The noise of creaking
saddles and the beat of the horses’ feet on the
baked earth prevented the boy’s voice from
carrying far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ike Natick’s?” Roy countered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know his name. The puncher who
came over with Bug Eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His name is Natick. He’s a new hand.
Bug Eye says he hasn’t been with their outfit
very long. But he says he’s a good man, and
I think he is, too. He impresses me as being
all cowboy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just wanted to get your idea. I like him
O. K. myself. Kind of long and stringy, but
he’s built like a rawhide whip. So you think
we can depend on him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, Teddy. Anyway, we’ve got to.
He’s the only one who knows anything about
this business, and it’s nothing more than pure,
dumb luck that he knows as much as he does.
He spoke of a woman being in the car. I’m
sure glad of that, but I wonder who she could
have been?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some half-breed probably, carried along to
take care of the girls. Those rustlers are not
exactly fools, I guess, and they know that if
anything serious happened their lives wouldn’t
be worth a plugged nickel. I reckon the girls
will be treated fairly, all right, and I’m not
worried about that. But I can’t stand the
thought of those jailbirds holding Belle and
Ethel and Nell captives while they dictate
terms to us! That sort of gets under my skin,
by golly! Then, too, unless we find them soon,
we can’t tell what—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled Flash aside to avoid a sharp depression
and left his sentence unfinished. But
Roy understood. He knew that they could
not afford to delay, as the rustlers might become
desperate and determine to abandon the
girls to their fate rather than risk capture red-handed.
Haste was imperative. While the
girls were in the hands of gunmen and horse
thieves they were in dire peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the riders proceeded, they left behind
that deserted waste and came into a more fertile
country. They were nearing Thunder
Canyon, through which ran a turbulent stream,
and the nourishment derived from this water
changed the grasses from a lifeless brown to a
soft green. They made better speed now, the
footing being much surer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before them rose a high mountain. They
were to skirt this, for along its side was Thunder
Canyon. Other mountains bordered the
gulch, but these could not yet be seen. At the
foot of the rise Mr. Manley called a halt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Natick!” he shouted, “ride up here a second,
will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The puncher complied, and stood near Roy
and Teddy, who had approached their father
and Mr. Ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right over there lies Thunder Canyon,”
Mr. Manley declared, and pointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ike Natick grunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, boss. An’ that’s the place I
mean. Somewhere in there you’ll find those
girl-stealin’ gunmen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea?” Mr. Manley looked at him sharply.
“What makes you so sure, Natick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t sure, boss; but I got a hunch. An’
my hunches usually turn out pretty good. Besides
that, it wasn’t so far from here that I
saw the car comin’ this way. Don’t that road
to the 8 X 8 wind past those hills over there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what,” Pop Burns, who was listening,
answered. “She runs right past them
hills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’m sure right,” Ike Natick drawled.
“That auto come into this here canyon.
Course, they may have switched to horses later,
’cause the ground around here ain’t none too
good fer a car. I don’t know nothin’ about
that. But you hear me, boss, an’ head fer that
there cut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete Ball turned to Mr. Manley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he knows what he’s talking about,
Bardwell,” he said in a low voice. “Ike hasn’t
been with me long, but I’ve found he’s a born
puncher, an’ he sure knows the West. I’m in
favor of takin’ his advice an’ searchin’ that
gorge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the owner of the X Bar X
ranch sat silent, thinking. He took his corncob
pipe from his shirt pocket and stuck it, unlit,
between his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll agree with you, Pete,” he said finally.
“Pop, come here! You know more about Thunder
Canyon than any man of us—or you should.
Is there any place in it that might do for a
stronghold for rustlers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say there is, boss!” Pop replied loudly.
“The Sholo Caves near Gravestone Falls! I
helped route a gang from there when I was
ridin’ fer yore father, boss. An’ we had some
job, let me tell you! We’d never have gotten
’em loose if one of their men hadn’t welched
and let us past. But we found out one thing—that
the only way to really get a bunch out of
those caves is to come at ’em from both sides
of the canyon at once. The men on the other
side keep ’em covered while those on this side
stick ’em up. If we’d only knowed that when
we had our fight, it would’ve turned out different.
As it was, most of the rustlers got away.
Me, I was with the party that—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Pop,” Mr. Manley said quickly,
forestalling any attempt at one of the long
speeches for which the veteran puncher was
famous. “That tells us what we want to know.
We head for Sholo Caves, men! Teddy, Roy,
listen to me! You two are goin’ to take the
side with the caves on with Nick, Gus Tripp,
an’ Bug Eye. Pete an’ I will ride across from
you with the other men. We’ve got to keep in
touch with each other. I guess you’ve been
through Thunder Canyon before, boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure we have, Dad,” Roy answered.
“Though there are some parts of it pretty
wide. If we can stay opposite each other till
we get to the narrow part, we’ll be all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manley nodded in approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’ve been thinkin’,” he said.
“But we have to chance that, I guess. You
keep up the same pace we took comin’ over
here, an’ I’ll do likewise. When we get to the
Falls, where she’s narrow, we ought to be
pretty near opposite each other. Anyway,
we’ll wait there until we get together. Anybody
want to ask any questions before we start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men were silent. The only questions
they would ask would be of their guns—that
they might not miss when the time came for action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before separating, the boys shook hands
with their father. The grips were momentary,
but they were firm, and told of sentiments
which were more easily sensed than spoken.
Each knew the danger he was about to face,
and realized that this was the last time he
might see the other alive. Certainly, there was
the possibility of a tragic end to this serious
business. Men who would kidnap girls would
not hesitate to shoot to kill if the occasion
arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hence the boys knew well to what they were
riding. Yet rather than hesitation, there was
about them an eagerness which welcomed whatever
might befall. Their sister was somewhere
in that canyon. They were going to find her
and Nell and Ethel, and not all the bullets ever
moulded would prevent them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good luck, boys,” Mr. Manley said, as he
sat quietly in his saddle a moment before starting.
“Keep your powder dry an’ your guns
clean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who heard him seemed to feel the old
West rush upon them—the West with pistols
leveled and eyes narrowed, the West that had
produced a man like the boss of the X Bar X.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t shoot unless you have to. But remember
that Belle is in there, an’, if you have
to shoot, don’t waste no bullets. I guess that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He chirped to his pony. The boys did the
same, and the father and his two sons separated,
riding back to back. Behind Teddy
and Roy come Nick Looker, Gus Tripp, and
Bug Eye. The others were with Mr. Manley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The canyon opened out before them. Mr.
Manley’s party had already entered it and
were lost to sight behind the trees which bordered
its edge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy and Roy looked down. At the bottom
of the cut they could hear the faint tinkle of
the running stream. From this rivulet the
sides of rock rose perfectly straight, like the
walls of two huge buildings. Then, higher up,
the canyon gradually broadened, making a sort
of V. Along the top edge of this V rode the
boys, while towering over them, the taller
mountains reared. It was a gorge within a
gorge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Teddy’s eyes swept over the tremendous
expanse his heart faltered for a moment in
sudden despair. How were they ever to find
the girls in this place? The task was hopeless!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he remembered his mother’s words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll be with us before to-morrow
night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Touching Flash with his spurs, Teddy rode
on.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>A Woman Threatens</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Yore dad took this mighty well,” Nick declared,
riding close to Roy. Teddy, Gus and
Bug Eye drew up in the rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He never does show much of what’s going
on inside him,” Roy answered slowly.
“You notice he didn’t say hardly anything on
the way over. Dad’s hard hit, I know that.
And—and so are we.” He turned his head
away for a moment and stared long and hard
at something on the other side of the rugged
canyon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick moved uneasily in his saddle. At a
time like this he was speechless. He did not
know what he could say to console his friend,
for his own heart was none too happy. His
lips opened, but words would not come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To punchers on the X Bar X, the ranch was
as much a home as a place to work. Troubles
were shared equally. Mr. Manley treated his
men not like employees, but as friends who
were helping him, and the boys appreciated
this attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that this cruel misfortune had come
to the Manley family, every cowboy on the
ranch felt it. Belle was loved and respected by
every man on the place. Sing Lung, the cook,
not excepted. When word had gone around
that Belle had been kidnapped, a hot rage filled
the hearts of the inmates of the bunk-house.
Belle—little Belle, she of the raven black hair
and laughing eyes—taken by rustlers! At first
there had been a wild rush for horses and guns
were out and ready in a moment. But cooler
heads prevailed, and finally the boys had come
to Mr. Manley, offering themselves quite
simply for whatever he planned to do, whether
it meant facing a rain of lead or not. He had
thanked them huskily and told them to make
ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These thoughts were running through Nick’s
mind as he rode along. If it was that they
were to see Belle no more, if she were killed by
the gunmen— He moved from side to side, as
a caged animal moves. They’d run those jailbirds
down, if it took them all their lives!
And when they found them—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reckon there’ll be any scrappin’?” Gus
drawled, watching Teddy guide Flash carefully
over bad ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Expect so.” The boy looked casually at
the gun in his saddle holster. “Shots will
make an awful roar in this canyon. Gus, what
would happen to a man who fell that far?” He
looked down toward the bottom of the dark
space beneath him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothin’—that is, nothin’ that he’d know
about,” Gus answered promptly. “Why, ain’t
aimin’ to jump, are yuh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not any.” Teddy laughed shortly. “But
those caves, as I remember, are pretty close to
the edge. Might be that one of those gunmen
would lose his balance, accidental like, and slip.
I was just wondering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gus nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such might happen. Get a better view of
it if a man was to watch the fall from the
rear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I was thinking.” Teddy called
to his brother. “Say, Roy, let’s cut over to
the right. The going is easier there, and we
can move faster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy considered this for a moment. He had
not heard Teddy’s conversation with Gus. Bug
Eye explained matters in no uncertain terms,
however, and Roy soon saw the advisability of
approaching the caves from the rear. “But
we don’t want to lose touch with dad,” he
stated. “When the action starts, he’s to take a
stand on the other side of the canyon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ pop away at us?” Nick asked wonderingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum,” Roy pulled his pony to a halt and
pushed back his hat. “That’s a point, Nick.
Now let’s see. Those caves, if I remember
rightly, though I haven’t been through here in
three years, are almost at the end of this canyon.
How about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many of ’em are there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t just say. No one knows
exactly, ’cause they haven’t all been explored.
But I got a sort of idea they’re all connected,
somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now if we ride in from the rear, as you
said, Teddy, and dad’s gang starts to shoot
from the other side, it’s going to be mighty uncomfortable
for us. Nope, we’ll have to stick
close to the edge of the gorge. Then, when we
get nearer, we can decide on our plan of action.
But, golly, maybe the rustlers aren’t
there at all! We may be all wrong. At any
rate, it’s the only clew we have, so we may as
well go by it. Anybody got any other suggestions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might send a man ahead when we get
there to sound things out,” Bug Eye said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was counting on that. Teddy or I will reconnoiter
and report back. If we only could
make sure that we’re going right! All this
time, while we’re in here, the thieves may
be—” Roy stopped, and shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what can we do?” Teddy asked helplessly.
“Natick said he saw the car head this
way and Pop claims those caves are about the
only place around here that the outlaws could
use for a stronghold. If we’re wrong, we’ll
have to start over again, that’s all. It may
take time, but we’ve simply got to sit tight and
work our way over every possible spot where
they could have hidden the girls. And we’ll
get ’em—we’ll get ’em, by jinks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell a maverick we will!” Roy burst
out. “Come on, boys, let’s hit it up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far is that narrow place from here,
Nick, where we were going to see dad?” asked
Teddy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, quite a piece yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more they started, in single file now,
for the trail was getting narrower. As they
rounded a bend they caught sight of the stream
below, which up to this time had been hidden
by an overhanging ledge. They were riding
downward now, and gradually they approached
the bottom of the cut. But a little farther on
they hit an up-grade where the path hugged the
side of the rock so closely that the boys had to
proceed with infinite caution. Their ponies
were sure-footed, however, and they passed
this dangerous spot without a mishap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sun’s goin’ down,” Bug Eye remarked,
after a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one replied to this, each man contenting
himself with a single glance toward the west.
They had expected to spend at least one night
in the gorge, but Roy hoped they would get in
touch with his father before darkness overtook
them. They might easily lose track of each
other if they tried to travel after nightfall, as
the woods on the other side of the canyon were
heavy and deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See anything of the other gang?” Teddy
asked, when they had ridden for some time in
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others shook their heads. They were
watching the opposite side eagerly, but the
trees prevented them from obtaining a view
of any riders that might be across from them.
Besides, the gorge widened here, and they
scarcely expected to see their companions until
they reached the narrow part near Gravestone
Falls, which was still a long ride ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they get there before we do they’ll
wait,” Roy remarked. “Dad wants us to be all
together when we come in sight of the caves.
He’ll be a mighty disappointed man if Ike’s
hunch turns out wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’ll we all,” Teddy agreed, with something
strangely like a sigh. The long ride had
given the boys ample time to think, which was
the worst thing in the world for them. They
needed action, and more than one man among
them felt his hand wandering down toward the
gun on his saddle or his hip. Thinking about
the girls seemed to bring all sorts of wild
fancies to the mind, though both Roy and
Teddy were wise enough to know they must not
harbor thoughts of failure. Worry would only
use up their energy, and they would need all of
that later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Roy, who was leading, held up his
hand. Those behind him halted their horses
and peered ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember this place, Nick?” the boy asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The puncher slowly shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t, Roy. Seems like it’s been
widened since I rode over here last. As I remember
it, this here path led right along the
edge. Now she branches out, kind of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had come to a clearing on the side of
the canyon. For a short space in front of them
the ground was bare of bushes and trees, as
though it had been purposely cleared. Motioning
the others to follow, Roy rode on. A moment
later, those behind Roy gave an exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up, Roy?” Teddy asked quickly,
springing his horse forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy pointed in silence. Just within the
fringe of trees on the very edge of the clearing
was a small cabin. Smoke was issuing from
the chimney. And as the boys watched, a
woman, old, stooped, and white-haired, her
face creased with lines, came to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mex!” whispered Nick excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To their surprise the woman suddenly disappeared
into the hut. Roy started to urge
his pony forward. Then quickly he pulled the
reins taut, bringing Star to a halt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman had come to the door again, and
the boys could see her mouth twisted in rage.
Her shoulders were thrown back and her eyes
blazed. In her hands she held a long-barreled
rifle, and, as the riders remained motionless,
she lifted and leveled it with a steady hand.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Captives</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>The auto containing the three girls came to a
dead stop. The driver turned to his companion,
an old woman in a dress resembling a
Gypsy’s gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This the place, Cleopatra?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman nodded. Then she turned on
him fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name Clovita! You no call me that
other. Clovita my mother’s name, and her
mother’s name before her. You no—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, all <span class='it'>right</span>! I’ll call you Clove for
short. That do? <span class='it'>Cloves</span> would just about suit
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman made no reply, but, instead,
turned and gazed stolidly at the three girls
who sat in the rear seat and who were listening
to this conversation with wildly beating
hearts. Half an hour ago they had known that
the man driving was not taking them home, but
he had put them off with excuses that he had to
stop some place first. Now Belle leaned forward
and looked at him squarely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Richmond,” she said firmly, “we want
to know the meaning of this. We are not going
home. This is nowhere near the X Bar
X. Where are you taking us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, I wouldn’t just say you’re not
goin’ home,” the man drawled. “Let’s say
you’re not goin’ home yet. That sounds better.
Now what else did you want to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belle felt the blood leave her face. She
turned to the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be frightened,” she said in a low
voice. “He may be just trying to scare us.
He won’t dare keep us away long. Dad would
kill him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would, hey?” The man laughed nastily.
“So sure of that, Miss Spitfire? Maybe there’s
others around that can do a little killin’ on
their own hook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ethel gave a slight scream and began to
tremble. Nell, taking her cue from Belle,
clenched her teeth and remained silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man spoke to the woman at his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When were they coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“T’ree ’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s four now. Sure this is the right
place? If you’re foolin’ me, I’ll—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man bent his head sideways. In the distance
sounded the beat of horses, evidently
traveling toward the car, as the noise increased
rapidly. The woman, not troubling to speak,
jerked one thumb in the direction of the approaching
ponies. The man nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belle, taking her courage in both hands, suddenly
alighted from the car. She saw, out of
the corners of her eyes, that the man had
opened the door on his side and had slid himself
out a bit from under the steering wheel.
Belle knew that any attempt at escape would
be met with instant violence, and she had no
notion of giving this man an opportunity of
tying her up. She simply stood by the side
of the car and looked about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place they had come to was familiar. It
was the entrance to Thunder Canyon. Belle
felt her heart give a jump of anxiety, for this
was many miles from the X Bar X. She had
known that something unusual was happening
as soon as the car had stopped and had taken
on the old woman, whom the driver explained
by saying she was a relative of one of the cowboys
and was going over to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman, thinking such subterfuge unnecessary,
had cackled shrilly, only to be silenced
by a fierce frown from the man. It was then
that Belle realized the turn affairs had taken.
But she had refrained from alarming Nell and
Ethel, both because it would be useless and because
she hoped that if their driver could be
lulled into thinking his motives were unsuspected,
the girls might have a chance to escape.
For it was certain that Richmond was no
puncher on the X Bar X.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had all happened so casually and so naturally
that it was some time before the girls
had become suspicious. The man had called at
the 8 X 8 in the flivver with a note which Belle
Ada was certain had been sent by her mother.
The explanation, too, was natural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls, eager for a change, had hurriedly
packed and gotten in the car, chatting merrily
and not paying much attention to the driver
who, it was remembered now, had regarded
them grimly as he drove off with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So merry had the trio been, anticipating
much fun with Roy and Teddy at the Manley
ranch, that they scarcely noted the direction
taken by the driver. It was not until he
stopped at a hut in a lonely place and the
gaudily attired woman came out that Belle
Ada glanced at Ethel and Nell strangely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with the woman in the car with them,
had followed a long ride with suspicions increasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belle realized that they were in a serious predicament—just
how serious she could not yet
tell, for, except for the knowledge that the
driver was not connected with the X Bar X
Ranch and that the note had been a forgery, the
girl was as much in the dark as ever. But she
did not lose heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swiftly she glanced about her. Those hoofbeats
were coming closer, and she knew if an
escape were to be attempted, it must be soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Richmond,” Belle said slowly, turning
toward the front seat, “I suppose it is useless
to ask you for an explanation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the man answered, he hitched up his
belt, and Belle saw the butt of a revolver protruding
over the door of the car. She pretended
not to notice, and waited for his reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter—ain’t you comfortable?”
the man countered. “I even brought
Cleopatra along to—all right, Clovita, then!
Don’t go bitin’ my ear off. I say I brought
Clove along to keep you company. She’ll make
a fine travelin’ companion, won’t you, Cleo—won’t
you, Clove?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ethel, who was almost as pale as her white
collar, put her hand to her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Traveling—traveling companion?” she faltered.
“What do you mean? Where are you
taking us? Oh, Nell, I’m so frightened!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You nice lady,” came from the old woman,
who was grinning widely. “You no get scared.
Everyt’ing all right. You maybe go on a visit
for a little while with me, and I show you pretty
things. See!” and she held out her hand. Nell
took from it a bracelet, apparently of finely
wrought gold. Out of curiosity the girls examined
it until they felt Richmond observing them
strangely. With a shudder Nell handed it back.
The moment the woman had it in her hand again
Richmond seized it viciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tryin’ to get away with somethin’, hey?”
he snarled. “We was to go fifty-fifty on all
stuff you picked up, an’ you know it. Where’d
you get this, hey? Some fool lady who wanted
her fortune told, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman nodded, and grinned. Then she
shrugged her shoulders and spread her hands
wide—disdainfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you? I must live. People say
Clovita has the gift of prophecy. As to that—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was interrupted by the arrival of four
men on ponies. They rode swiftly up, looked at
the car and its occupants for a moment, then
turned to Richmond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good work,” one of them said. “Yuh shore
know yore doggies, Jack. We all set?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep. Hey, Clove, pile out. Here’s where
you get yore liver shook up good. Sheldon,
slide off that war horse an’ let a lady up. Come
on, Cleo, shake yore stumps. When you get up
there, hang on. Don’t let ’er throw yuh.
Ready? <span class='it'>Alley-oop!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a groan, the old woman, assisted by
Sheldon and Richmond, climbed to the back of
the pony Sheldon had just quit. Once in the
saddle, she took the reins with a practiced hand
and settled her dresses about her with supreme
confidence. Evidently she had been a rider in
her day, but now she made a strange picture
sitting proudly on the horse, her head thrown
back, surveying with a scornful eye those on
the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richmond grinned widely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite a gal,” he said to Sheldon. “Feel
O.K., Clove? That bronc’s gentle, an’ you
won’t have no trouble with her. If she rears,
sock her on the head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clovita know,” the woman replied with
dignity. “But I not hit a horse on the head—never.
They die from that. Clovita rode
horses before you were born. Wild horses,
that ran like fire! No one could ride like
Clovita, I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang it up,” Richmond said brutally.
Then: “Miss Manley, I must ask you to
change cars at this station. Sorry, but the
road ain’t so good fer autos. The other young
gals too. Boys, pile off. We go back in the
car. You girls ride with Clove. We’ll see you
later, so don’t pine too much when we leave.
And now—<span class='it'>adios</span>.” He bowed mockingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” Belle demanded, the
blood coming to her cheeks like a flame. “You
won’t dare take us! We must go home immediately!
If my father hears about this, you’re
life won’t be worth a plugged nickel!” Unconsciously
she had quoted Roy. “Dad’ll kill
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richmond looked at her, a grudging admiration
in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just take it easy, girlie,” he said gently.
“Nothin’ is goin’ to happen to you or your
friends. You’ll be as safe here as if you were
home. This is just a little matter between yore
father an’ us, an’ we take this way to settle it.
See? But don’t get fretful. We may be rustlers
an’ all that, but we’re men. I just want
to add one thing.” His eyes narrowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As long as you behave yourselves, you can
do pretty much as you please an’ nobody will
touch you. But if you try to escape—” He
took a heavy gun from his pocket and handed
it up to Clovita as she sat on the pony. “Clovita,”
he continued sternly, “take a pot shot at
that hunk of wood stickin’ out by that rock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gun roared. Wide eyed, the girls looked
to where Richmond pointed. The stick had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That white blaze on the tree over there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another roar. A tiny dot appeared in the
center of the blaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you girls see she can shoot some.
Clovita, you know what I told you. Let ’em
ride ahead an’ keep their distance. If they
bolt, bring down the horse an’ let ’em walk the
rest of the way. If they start to run, just nip
’em a <span class='it'>leetle</span> bit. Then you won’t have no more
trouble. You know where to head for. We’ll
meet you there later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped and looked at the girls, who
stood by the car, Belle defiant, Ethel frankly
trembling, Nell pale, but game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry to have to do this, but you’ll
understand why later,” Richmond went on.
“When we hear from yore dad an’ if he answers
the way we think he will, you’ll be home
right soon. If not—” He shrugged his shoulders.
“But I’m not worrying about that.
Now, climb aboard, you girls. I guess you all
can ride. If not, you’ll have to learn quick.
The ponies are gentle an’ won’t buck none.
Come on, boys.” He entered the car. From
behind the wheel he stuck his head out.
“Clove,” he called sharply, “remember what I
told you! Don’t let ’em get funny, or you’ll
wish you hadn’t! Keep that gun out! Hop in
here, you birds. We got to get this car back.
Well, girls—” and he grinned and removed his
hat—“see you later! So long! Have a nice
trip!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Bug Eye Sings</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>The small group of riders in that clearing in
Thunder Canyon sat silent on ponies that
pawed the ground restlessly. The old woman
who stood before them, gun in hand, whistled
shrilly. Out of the cabin bounded a dog, a huge
mastiff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kind of thinkin’ things over now, ain’t
ye?” the woman cackled. “You fellers jest
keep yer hands on the pommels of yer saddles—no
lower. What’s the idee, scarin’ peaceful
folks outen their sleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, ma’am,” Gus drawled, “course we
didn’t know you was restin’. But it seems to
me like we didn’t have no band playin’ when
we rode up. An’ if it’s all the same to you,
keep an easy finger on that trigger. She might
be loaded, an’ accidents will happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet she’s loaded! Heavy buckshot,
too! Don’t make no mistake about that! What
you-all want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, of you,” Roy spoke up loudly.
“We didn’t even know you were here. We
were riding up the canyon, and just happened
on your place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye did, hey?” The woman considered this,
but did not lower the rifle. “Don’t sound
likely. There’s not many folks ride by here
nowadays. What’s yer business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sellin’ seed catalogs,” Nick answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seed catalogs? Ain’t never heard mention
of ’em. But let me tell you—this here canyon
ain’t healthy fer strangers, especially them
that carry guns in saddle-holsters. If I was
you, I’d turn right around and ride the other
way. The scenery is fine at the other end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not looking at scenery,” Teddy said
shortly. “And we’re anxious to get on. So
if you’ll just depress that cannon of yours,
we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a powerful hurry, ain’t ye? Sol—” this
to the dog—“jest you do a little investigatin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the surprise of the boys, the dog walked
forward, stiff legged, and sniffed loudly at the
ponies and their riders. The horses watched
him with suspicious eyes, but made no attempt
to bolt. The inspection over, the dog returned
to his mistress and casually flopped down at
her feet. Then, and not till then, did the rifle
butt rest upon the ground. The woman leaned
on the barrel, her eyes glittering strangely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky fer ye my dawg gives ye a clean
bill,” she said, with a little laugh. “Sol, here,
is my outpost, an’ nothin’ goes by here that he
don’t give the once over—not nothin’!” She
spat energetically. “Now, if you-all have a
mind to, ye can ride on. But stay clear of the
cabin. Sol don’t like strangers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bug Eye cast a quick look at Teddy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe we ain’t in such a hurry as we was,”
he stated carelessly. “Kind of hot, ridin’.”
He dismounted slowly, and gave the reins of
his mount to Gus to hold. “I guess you won’t
mind if I go around back an’ help myself to a
little water outen the pump, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rifle barrel menaced the figure on foot.
Bug Eye started in simulated surprise.
“You’re goin’ to stay right where you air,”
the woman said viciously. “Don’t you come
snoopin’ around me! Sol, watch him!” The
dog trotted forward, teeth bared, growling
menacingly. “Puncher, if you want to stay
whole, don’t move! My dawg ain’t had a workout
in two weeks, an’ he sure craves action!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bug Eye looked down at the animal, thrust
out his hand experimentally, and then quickly
withdrew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t exactly aimin’ to take on no dog,”
he muttered. “I guess you don’t like visitors,
ma’am, from the looks of things. Well, I stay
thirsty, I can see that.” Keeping an eye on
the dog, he remounted. “You ain’t never heard
of the book of etiquette, I reckon. Ought to
get it, ma’am. Do you a lot of good. It says
in there to always treat a guest with the utmost
consideration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was talking, Bug Eye glanced
rapidly toward the cabin. He gave an almost
imperceptible jerk to his head, and the others
gradually worked their horses a bit nearer the
hut and in a wider circle. “You must be right
lonely here, all alone. Got a radio? You
ought to get one. Heard a new song on the
radio only last night. Goes something like
this:” He threw back his head, and raised his
voice almost to a shout:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“Come out o’ the kitchen, Mary darlin’,</p>
<p class='line'>Come out o’ the kitchen, Mary Ann.</p>
<p class='line'>Come out—”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Stop that yellin’!” the woman cried
fiercely. “Stop it, I tell ye! If you don’t—”
She raised the gun, her face twisted into a
snarl of rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m stoppin’,” Bug Eye said quickly. “I
thought you might like to hear it. No need to
get nasty. An’ that gun makes me nervous.
Snakes, you sure are touchy, ma’am! Objectin’
to a little singin’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more his eyes roved in the direction of
the cabin. The interior was dark and the windows
gave no indication of what was within.
Bug Eye waved his hand expressively, so that
it would be visible to any one who might be
watching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all this canyon to fool around in, you
oughtn’t to be so touchy over a song,” the
puncher went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I am!” the woman snapped. “I
don’t like noise—especially that kind. I think
you-all mentioned somethin’ about ridin’ on,
a ways back. If I was you, I’d do jest that.
Soon be dark, an’ it ain’t nice to be alone in the
canyon at night,” and the woman snickered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I reckon not,” Gus drawled. He
winked at Teddy. “Is there any place we could
stop if we didn’t make the end by night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know.” The woman backed into the
doorway and glanced swiftly behind her. Then
she faced the riders again. “Good-bye. Don’t
come no closer as you go along. My finger
ain’t as steady as it once was, an’ this gun
might go off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy whispered to the others:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, let’s be going. We’re wasting
time here. She’d just as soon pepper us as
not. I’d like to come by here later, when she
isn’t so lively.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy chirped to Flash. Slowly the five
riders filed past the cabin. Their last vision
of the woman was as she stood in the doorway,
her rifle held in the crook of her arm, her
lips compressed tightly. As they turned their
backs to her, each felt a prickly sensation run
up his spine, as if those black eyes were boring
into him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they rounded a bend, out of sight and
hearing of the cabin, Roy called a halt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, laughing shortly. “That’s
that! What a friendly customer <span class='it'>she</span> was!
What the mischief do you suppose she was
afraid of? I wonder—” His face flushed, as
an idea came to him suddenly. “Do you suppose—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was supposin’ that all along,” Bug Eye
answered dryly. “The girls! It sure looked
like a likely place to hide ’em. But they’re not
there—not now, anyways. I made sure of that.
Unless they was tied up tight an’ couldn’t
move,” he added, his face serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I kind of thought you had an idea behind
that crazy song of yours,” Teddy remarked.
“And when you waved, too. But I couldn’t
see a thing through those windows. I’m afraid
there’s not much to it, Bug Eye. If I thought
there was a possibility of Belle being hidden
in there, I’d rush it, woman or no woman! But
what’s the use? We’d only get into trouble
and maybe some one would have his head
blown off. That was a powerful gun she had
there. Besides, if the girls were there, there’d
be men about to prevent any rescue or escape.
What do you think about it, Roy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m willing to admit I didn’t get it at all,”
his brother answered. “But now you speak of
it, there’s nothing more likely than that the
girls would be taken to some such place as
that. Then with that old woman and all—you
remember what Ike Natick said about the
woman? There she was, as big as life, and
then some. But I reckon it was another woman.
That was a clever idea of yours, that song,
Bug Eye. It proved one thing to me—that the
girls are not there now, whether they will be
later or not. Even if they were bound, they
would have made some noise when they heard
us. We came up too suddenly to allow
that gunwoman any time to gag them. But
it looks suspicious! As soon as we come into
her yard, she’s out with her rifle and tells us
to make ourselves scarce. What for? She
must have had some reason!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy shook his head, and Nick said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s too many for me. But there’s something
in the wind besides the smell of fryin’
onions, or I’m a ring-tailed dodo-bird. That
hag’ll bear watchin’. It ain’t natural for a
woman to be as suspicious as she was without
havin’ something on her mind, an’ I’d give a
lot to know what it is. I’ll bet if we knew, we
wouldn’t have so far to go to find Belle Ada
and the others! But—” He shrugged his
shoulders expressively. “You can’t go over
an’ threaten to shoot her unless she tells all
she knows. It ain’t bein’ done this season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope, boys, we got to ride on to the caves.
Maybe when we get there we can discover somethin’
to go by. This Ike Natick—he’s with our
outfit, you know—strikes me as a level-headed
cow puncher. Besides that, there ain’t no
ribbons tied on him, he’s all man. When he
says a thing, I listens. An’ he said he’s got
a hunch the rustlers headed for Sholo Caves.
That’s enough fer me. What do ya say, Roy—do
we go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do, Bug Eye. Dad might be waiting
for us when we get near Gravestone Falls. I
hope so, anyway. Hit it up, boys, it’s getting
dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more the riders, single file, made their
way up the canyon. The sun threw its slanting
rays on the brown stone walls, streaking
them with gold. Below them the stream
gurgled over the rocks. Back of them, in a
small clearing an old woman stood in the
doorway of a cabin, leaning on the barrel of
a rifle, her eyes fixed toward them in a malevolent
glare.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Into the Cave</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>The rocky walls of the gorge echoed to the
sound of the slow, deliberate hoof-beats as four
horses were urged over the trail on the edge
of Thunder Canyon, the steeds carrying three
girls followed by an old woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later this same trail was to be
the path of another group of riders, who, doggedly
pursuing, were to find this same deep
gulch the scene of a desperate fight for the
rescue of these present travelers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly they went, those ahead riding unwillingly.
In the extreme rear rode the woman,
a striking counterpart to another of her sex
who dwelt in a lonely cabin on the edge of a
clearing, long since passed by the wayfarers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had halted for a moment at this hut,
and their guard, who carried before her a
heavy gun held in a firm hand, had whistled
to the cabin’s occupant. When the second
woman appeared Belle started, as did the others,
at the remarkable resemblance between
the two. They were exactly of the same height
and their faces were strangely similar, as
though the lines in each countenance had come
of the same experiences. “Sisters—maybe
twins,” Nell had whispered, and the others
nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few minutes the two old hags remained
in close conversation, the one who had come
with the girls never for a second relaxing her
vigilance or allowing the gun to point in any
direction but toward the horses. With that
blue barrel menacing them, the girls knew that
escape was out of the question. They seemed
in no present danger, however, and Ethel had
largely recovered from her first fright. Belle,
tight-lipped, was occupied with furious
thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That such a thing could happen in a civilized
country! They were kidnapped—neither more
nor less! Kidnapped! Belle bit her lips and
her face clouded. Mother! How she would
worry when she found out! They <span class='it'>must</span> escape
somehow, and get back home before her mother
heard they were missing!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was characteristic of the girl that she gave
her own safety scarcely a thought. Richmond
had said they were not to be harmed, but that
they were to be held until her father did the
rustler’s bidding. Belle smarted at the indignity
of being a weapon in the hands of the
horse thieves, for she now realized who her
captors were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course she had heard of the note her
father had received, and gradually the conviction
had grown on her that this was the means
the rustlers had taken to “square up” matters
between them and the X Bar X. The cowards!
To use girls to effect their revenge! Belle’s
lips curled in contempt. If that was the kind
they were, they couldn’t stand up long against
the punchers on the X Bar X! Why, Teddy and
Roy would soon send them running for cover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the girl thought of her brothers, her heart
beat rapidly with hope. They would hear of
their disappearance and ride after them. If
they only knew which way to head! All sorts
of wild ideas surged through the girl’s brain,
but she realized that it would be impossible
to send word to the ranch. All they could do
was to wait and pray that the boys started in
the right direction, when they took up the
chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this time the two women were talking.
Now and then their guard would nod in the
girls’ direction and the other woman would
grin evilly. Of the two, Belle much preferred
the one who was riding with them. Somehow,
she seemed more kind, even though, thus far,
she had treated them with small consideration.
Still, Belle felt that she would do nothing cruel
as long as they made no attempt to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the conversation was concluded and
Clovita returned to her horse. After several
attempts, and with much grunting, she succeeded
in regaining the saddle, her sister, if
such the other women were, watching her
amusedly, making no offer of assistance. Then,
with the gun pointing at their backs, the girls
continued their weary ride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nell made several efforts at finding out their
destination, but each question was received in
stony silence. At length she desisted, and the
girls talked in low tones among themselves. As
they rode on, their courage returned to them,
and even Ethel seemed brighter. Belle Ada
comforted her with the declaration that Teddy
and Roy and her father and Peter Ball would
soon be aware of their capture—she preferred
that word to kidnapping—and would ride in
search of them. With both ranches, the X Bar
X and 8 X 8, in pursuit, their rescue was
but a matter of time. But even while she was
speaking, Belle realized how slim was the
chance of any one finding them in this wilderness,
and her heart sank within her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mile after mile along the canyon the girls, followed
closely by their guard, rode in silence.
As night approached and they still went on,
Belle saw Ethel’s shoulders shake with dry
sobs. The woman in the rear gave no sign,
but Belle rode to her friend and, reaching out,
seized her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t give in, Ethel dear,” Belle whispered.
“Look at Nell! She’s taking it like
a veteran. After all this is over and the boys
are with us again and those rustlers are back
in jail, think of the experiences we’ll have had.
Why, when you go back to New York and tell
people that you’ve been captured by a bunch of
real outlaws and made to ride for miles along
a canyon, to—to—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just it,” Ethel replied. “Where are
we going? Where is she taking us? I’m so
frightened!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, you frightened?” Nell scoffed, although
her own voice was none too strong.
“How about that time you and I were out sailing
on Long Island Sound by Fire Island and
the storm came up? You weren’t scared then,
Ethel. And that was <span class='it'>lots</span> worse than this is!
Why, I think this is sort of fun! As Belle
says, Teddy and Roy will find us, and I guess
we can take care of ourselves. Come on, Ethel,
don’t let that horrid old woman see that Easterners
aren’t as brave as Westerners! Buck
up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the talk!” Belle exclaimed, giving
Ethel’s hand a squeeze of encouragement.
“Here—” She passed Ethel a tiny handkerchief,
seemingly inadequate, but with a smile
Ethel dabbed at her eyes and handed it back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right—now,” she declared, patting
the pony she was riding. “Belle, did you notice
this horse? Isn’t he a positive beauty? I
wish I owned him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something tells me you will, later,” Belle
answered giving a laugh. Ethel’s smile had
cheered her immensely and things seemed not
nearly so dark. After all, this certainly was a
unique experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belle thought of the Western books she had
read and how she had scoffed at the adventures
the heroes and heroines had gone through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As though we of the West lived in a land
of nothing but rattlesnakes, cyclones, and
rustlers!” she once exclaimed. “Those things
they write about just don’t happen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now here she was, riding through a
canyon to some unknown, far-off place, with
a savage old woman forcing them on with a
pistol!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess they do happen, after all,” she
said to herself ruefully. “Although I’d rather
read about this than be where I am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was wise enough, however, to keep her
fears from the other girls. Indeed, she did all
in her power to cheer them, and insisted that
they would be rescued as soon as the boys and
her father and Mr. Ball found that they were
missing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’ll be as soon as Mrs. Ball telephones
home to see that we arrived safely,”
she added. Had she known at the time that
two whole days were to elapse before the kidnapping
was discovered, her courage might not
have been quite so high. Perhaps it was fortunate
that she remained in ignorance of this
fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were nearing the end of the canyon
now, and Belle looked sharply about her. Here
the cut seemed deeper than at any other place
and the trail narrower, as though Nature
wanted to end this scene with a setting of more
than usual grandeur. The canyon walls fell
straight away, ending at the gurgling stream
far below them, and on either side the mountains
arose, forming a protection from any
storm which might try to invade this fastness.
Belle, gazing for a moment down into the tremendous
depths, shivered in spite of herself.
A misstep here would mean quick, sure death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the path dipped sharply for a short
space, and, when they reached a level spot once
more, the woman with the gun called:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You stop here. Get off ponies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wonderingly, the girls obeyed, noticing that
the woman herself stayed mounted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead. Leave ponies,” was the next
command. As the girls proceeded, their guard
kept a careful eye on them. Not for a moment
did the gun relax from its threat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before they had gone fifty feet Belle and
the others saw the reason they were told to
dismount. Ahead of them, hewn in the solid
rock, was an entrance to a cavern of some sort.
Behind its rough, wooden door it was intensely
dark, and the girls caught themselves thinking
that if they were compelled to enter this cave
they might never see the light of day again.
But as they approached they saw that the entrance
led to a wide, airy room of rock, beyond
which a light of some sort glowed. This light
was not visible from the outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the woman slid from her horse and
walked toward the girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go in,” she said shortly, motioning
with the gun barrel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In there?” Ethel gasped, her face pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman nodded firmly, then bent to explain:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You no worry. I here. I no hurt you nor
let any one else hurt you. I not a bad woman,
but—” She seemed about to say more, then
closed her lips tightly. Once more she indicated
the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls had no choice. With fear in their
hearts and with faltering steps, they entered.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span><h1>CHAPTER XX</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>An Attempt that Failed</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>Once within the cave, Belle took a deep
breath. Nothing had happened yet. They
were still alive, at all events. She led the way
toward the light they had seen, and, to her
amazement, she discovered that on the left a
passageway led to another cavern, larger than
the first, which also was illuminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing a shuffling step behind them, the
girls turned swiftly, but it was only the old
woman, the light from the lamp in the wall
shining on the metal of her leveled revolver.
Whatever else might be said for her, she allowed
her charges no chance to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahead,” she grunted, and slowly the girls
entered the second cave. This had a high,
rocky roof. Several lighted lamps were fastened
to the walls. There was furniture of a
sort, there being a heavy table in the center,
while arranged along the wall were makeshift
cots, five of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a slight gasp, Ethel leaned against the
table. The woman grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No get scared,” she said. “All right. You
safe in here. We wait now till men come. But
you no worry. I here. You all safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That isn’t much assurance,” Nell whispered
to Belle. “What a strange place!
Surely they can’t mean to keep us here! Ethel
will almost die of fright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cast a swift look at her cousin, but the
girl seemed more courageous than she had been,
probably realizing that nothing could be gained
by showing her fear. So, although her underlip
trembled pitifully, Ethel suddenly approached
their guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think we’re going to submit to
this?” she demanded, a high color in her
cheeks. “That you—an old woman—can keep
us here? Don’t think we’re afraid of you!
We could— What’s that?” she broke off suddenly,
pointing to the doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unsuspectingly, the woman turned. The
next moment Ethel’s two hands had closed
over the gun, and, with a fierce look of determination
in her eyes, she struggled fiercely.
In a flash the other two leaped to her assistance,
and the woman was disarmed. Ethel, the
one who had been most frightened, had done
what the others dared not do!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” she panted, trembling so that she
could scarcely stand, “the tables are turned!
Let us out of here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman shrugged her shoulders stolidly,
and stood to one side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where you go?” she muttered. “Horses
gone. They go by themselves where you no
find them. You want to walk, all right. Long
ways,” and she grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ethel threw the gun on the table in despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could never make it,” she stammered,
her breath choked in her throat. “It’s too far!
This horrible canyon—” she could not finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the horses?” Bell asked, stepping
forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more Clovita shrugged her shoulders,
spreading her hands wide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look,” she said indifferently. “You
no find. They far away. Besides—” she
stopped, holding her hand to her ear—“I hear
men coming,” she concluded, with another
grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rustlers!” Nell gasped, seizing Belle’s
arm. “They’re coming here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A clatter of horses’ feet sounded on the path
outside. There were some muttered sentences,
which the girls could not catch, and a figure
filled the doorway. It was Richmond, the man
who had driven the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evenin’ ladies,” he greeted them, smiling
sardonically, his hat sweeping the ground.
Another smile was on his face as he turned to
the men behind him. “Our guests,” he added,
and the girls detected a sarcastic note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belle recognized the four men who had met
them at the entrance to the canyon, but this
time there were two others with them. One of
them looked vaguely familiar, but Belle could
not remember where she had seen him before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ethel shrank against the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be scared—we’re not poison,” Richmond
sneered. “Though your dad seems to
think we are,” he added, looking at Belle Ada.
“I see you got here all right,” he said to
Clovita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman nodded, but made no answer.
She glared at Richmond from beneath beetled
brows, her head bent low. Belle, observing
this by-play, was at a loss to account for the
woman’s apparent antagonistic attitude toward
Richmond until she recalled the episode
at the canyon’s mouth, when Clovita had protested
at the garbling of her name. Yet it did
not seem reasonable that any one would hate a
man simply because he had called her by a
name not her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richmond motioned Clovita to him, and for
some moments the two remained in low-voiced
conversation. Then Richmond spoke to the
girls:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have to leave now, sorry as you are to
see us go,” he said, grinning. “But remember
this—two of us will be on guard all night at
the door of this cave. If any of you try to
get out—” his eyes glittered dangerously—“you’ll
wish you hadn’t, that’s all. Clove,
here, will get you anything you want in the
line of food. She knows where the grub an’
water is. As for beds—” he motioned toward
the rude cots. “This ain’t no hotel, an’ you’ll
have to make out the best you can. The
sooner yore dad comes through, the sooner
you’ll be out of here. We’ll send him a note
to-morrow or the next day—give him a little
time to think it over first. In the meanwhile,
as long as you girls behave, you’ll be safe.
If you don’t—well, that’s up to you. Come
on, boys—we vamose. <span class='it'>Adios, señoritas!
Hasta mañana!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was gone. The old woman walked slowly
over to the table and casually picked up the
gun Ethel had thrown there. She carried it to
one of the couches and tossed it down as though
it was of no consequence. Then, shuffling
across the cave, she disappeared into the other
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three girls, with heavy hearts, watched
her depart. Escape seemed impossible, and
even rescue appeared unthinkable in this dismal
cave. Ethel struggled hard against tears, and
succeeded for a time in holding them back.
Belle and Nell themselves were not far from
weeping. Outside, the sun was casting its last
rays on the walls of the canyon, but those
within the cavern knew nothing of this. They
were held in a rocky jail, and guarding them
were two outlaws who would not hesitate to
shoot if the prisoners tried to escape. Small
wonder that hope departed from them and for
the first time they clung together, at length
finding relief in the tears which had been for
so long repressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until far in the night the three girls sat
on one of the cots, huddled close. The supper
they had been given was coarse, but there was
plenty of it. Yet they could not have eaten
much had the meal been a royal banquet. It
is impossible to feast when a lump keeps coming
into one’s throat and tears to the eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as time went on, and they still remained
unmolested, they took heart again and conversed
more cheerfully. True, it was lonesome
and cold in the cave. But to-morrow, surely,
help would come. To-morrow—that seemed so
far away, looking now into the blackness of
the cave. Even the friendly stars were hidden
from them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But morning came at last, and with it hope.
Clovita, who had slept near them, greeted them
with a toothless smile and informed them that
breakfast would soon be ready. With shudders,
they disclaimed any desire to eat, but
when they saw the food before them their
appetites conquered and they fell to with a
will. About two hours after sunrise Richmond
appeared and suggested they “come out an’
get a breath of fresh air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Realizing that they must preserve their
strength, the girls walked slowly to the mouth
of the cave. The canyon was drenched with
the morning sun, and it seemed impossible that
any villainy could exist amid such pleasant
surroundings. Belle caught Richmond watching
her with an amused smile on his lips, as
though he read her thoughts, and she turned
her back on him coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you please,” he said shortly, as he
walked toward one of his companions. “Like
it or not—you stay here until we hear from
yore dad. We send the note to-morrow, askin’
fer a certain amount of money. And if you’re
wise, you’ll hope he sends it, <span class='it'>pronto</span>! We’ve
got to get paid for the time we spent in jail,
due to your respected parent’s activities,” and
he grinned again sardonically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll not get dad to send you any money!”
Belle exclaimed hotly. “The only thing he’ll
send you will be hot lead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Richmond looked at her, then
he laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’you think of little Miss Spitfire?”
he asked his companions. “I’ll be sort of
sorry to see her leave, I’m gettin’ so used to
her!” Then, changing his tone, he added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As far as slingin’ lead goes, we got two men
who are experts in that line. They come from—well,
not from around here, at any rate. An’
if yore old man wants to try a little gun play,
we’re all set. In fact, anxious! I ain’t forgot
the fact that he rode all the way over to Hawley
just to see that we got ours. Nor we ain’t forgot—some
other things, too. So let him come
on.” His eyes narrowed. “But if he knows
what’s good for him, he’ll bring an army when
he arrives, ’cause if we start shootin’, it ain’t
goin’ to be safe fer himself nor fer them two
brothers of yours, either!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning on his heel, he walked up the trail,
his heavy colt swinging at his side. Belle felt
a shudder pass over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How much longer were they to be kept in
the lonesome place with only a fierce old woman
as a companion? How long?</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXI</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>The Reckless Rider</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>Dusk had settled over Thunder Canyon. A
cool breeze blew down from the mountains, and
the five horses sniffed it gratefully. They had
carried their riders far that day, over a trail
which stiffened their leg muscles and dulled
their eyes, from demanding constant attention
to its treacherous unevenness. But they
had done their work well, and now they were
near the end of their journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy, who was riding ahead, turned in the
saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much further?” he asked of Nick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much. You’ve kind of forgot this path,
ain’t yuh? Well, it’s a long time since I been
over it myself, but I’m thinkin’ Gravestone
Falls is just ahead. Right, Gus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon,” Gus drawled. “She’s narrowin’
down closer, anyhow,” and he jerked his head
toward the other side, which, it seemed to the
riders, had been gradually coming nearer as
they loped along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a scant hour of daylight remained, and
Roy, realizing they had small chance to join
his father and the others, once full darkness
had descended, urged Teddy to set a faster
pace. The tired horses responded willingly,
and the men made better time toward their
objective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the last hour or so the boys’ thoughts
had been taken up with the strange old woman
they had encountered in the clearing. Certainly
she fitted Ike Natick’s description of the
woman whom he had seen in the car which had
borne the three girls from the 8 X 8. Could
it be that the outlaws had forced their prisoners
to remain in that hut over Saturday and
Sunday, then, this morning, had taken them
farther on, so as to be safer from pursuit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy, revolving the subject over in his mind,
thought it extremely likely. If only they had
discovered on Saturday that the girls had been
taken, they might have had them at home by
this time! Teddy remembered, with an ironical
laugh, that he and Roy had at first planned
to visit the 8 X 8 on the very day the girls
were kidnapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the storm had come, and they had postponed
their journey until this morning, when
it was too late! What had happened to Belle
Ada—and the others—during those two days
when he and Roy were hanging around the
ranch, talking over ways to prevent the rustlers
from executing their threat? Why, at the
very moment when Mr. Manley and the two
boys had been deciding what part of the range
to watch, the outlaws had acted and had taken
revenge!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy grew stiff and his hands clenched.
All because of a storm! If it hadn’t rained,
he and Roy could have been after the rustlers
almost as soon as they got started. Or they
might even have arrived at the 8 X 8 at the
same time that the puncher, Richmond, had
come with the false note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy shook his head helplessly and gazed
ahead through the gathering dusk. To his ears
came the sound of falling water, but the boy
could not tell whether it was Gravestone Falls
or merely the brook below growing more turbulent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s hoping we meet dad soon,” Roy declared,
peering across the canyon. “It’ll be
night before long, and we’ll have a pretty hard
job of finding him then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy agreed, with a nod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be there. Remember, we were delayed
by that gunwoman in the cabin. If dad rode
straight on, which I think he did, he’s probably
at the falls now. Nick, watch your step!
There’s a mean bit of trail right here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick, who was following Roy, grunted to
show that he understood, and cautioned Gus
and Bug Eye, who drew up in the rear. Then
he called to Teddy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Expect to run across yore friend who rides
sidesaddle, Ted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sidesaddle? Oh, you mean the puncher
who slouches to the left? I sure do, Nick! I
hope to, anyhow. I guess Roy does, also.
We’ll ask him for his card and where he got
‘Reltsur’ for a name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think Richmond and Reltsur are the
same man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep! Nothing else but! The handwriting
on the note that Mrs. Ball showed us and on
the note that dad got are identical. We noticed
particularly the capital R; didn’t we,
Roy? Alike as two peas. I’m sure counting
on meeting that waddy personally, Nick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wish you luck.” Nick rested his hand on
the gun which hung from a saddle-holster.
“But don’t hog the action, Teddy—don’t hog
it! Me an’ Gus an’ Bug Eye are just rustin’
away from peacefulness. When the music
starts, Teddy, we’ll be there! Oh, we’ll be
there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell a maverick!” Roy exclaimed. “We
all will, Nick! And if those dirty horse
thieves have harmed Belle, or even frightened
her, we’ll—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it easy, boy,” Gus drawled, laying
his hand on Roy’s shoulder for a moment.
“Belle can take care of herself, and of the two
that’s with her, if she has to. I know Belle!
Not like you do, of course, but enough to say
that she’s one game little lady and that she can
hold her own with any sneak-thief that ever ran
from a jack-rabbit. Now don’t you start
worryin’, you nor Teddy either. So far, yore
takin’ it standin’ up. Keep it up, boys; it won’t
be long now!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow we can head fer Sholo Caves,
and then, if Ike is right, we’ll have all three
girls safe an’ sound. Then we can settle our
accounts with Reltsur an’ his gang.” He
paused for a moment, then went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know I’m talkin’ like a Dutch Uncle, but
I want you to know how I feel, an’ how Nick an’
the rest of us feel, too. I’m not sayin’ what
we’d do to get Belle back. I guess you know,
right enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy turned and looked at his friend, silently
grasped the hand that was held out to him, and
then grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You win, Gus. No more grousing. Star,
get along there! We rest soon. Guess a good
drink from that old stream will feel mighty
fine, hey? Well, you’ll get it. Come along,
now. There’s a lot of green grass waiting for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, from the depths of the canyon,
came a long shrill howl. The horses, hearing
it, snorted in fear. The grin froze on Roy’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Timber wolf,” he said shortly. “A brute,
from its yell. Didn’t know they came down this
far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy frowned fiercely, and, unconsciously,
his hand sought his gun butt. There were
wolves in this canyon. Belle, Ethel and Nell
were somewhere up that long, winding trail.
Wolves! The boy’s hand tightened on the gun.
No, he would not, could not, think that!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the men rode along in silence. The
scream of that animal had set their nerves on
edge, and they were in no mood for conversation.
It would have gone ill for the outlaws had
the rescue riders encountered them at that
moment. Each man gazed straight ahead, his
body rigid in the saddle. Each pony felt the
hand holding the reins stiffen and tighten ever
so slightly. Putting their heads down, the
ponies plodded on and on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the noise of the falls could be heard
distinctly. Teddy was about to make a remark
when he caught himself up quickly and motioned
for silence. Wondering, those following
came to a halt and listened. Then they
understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above the distant roar of Gravestone Falls
came another sound, a staccato drumming,
which, to the trained ear, was unmistakable.
With a quick movement the riders leaped their
horses off the path and into the brush. There
they waited, listening to those approaching
hoof-beats. Nearer and nearer they came.
Suddenly Teddy leaned over and tapped Roy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around a bend in the trail came a horseman.
He was riding furiously, seemingly heedless of
the desperate chance he was taking of being
hurled to the rocks below. And as the boys
watched, they saw something that caused their
hearts to leap with a sudden fierce joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horseman did not ride straight up in the
saddle, but slouched to the left!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXII</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Retribution</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy’s eyes flashed and he drew his revolver.
He made as if to urge Flash out into
the trail to face the oncoming horseman, but
Roy laid a restraining hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait!” he cautioned tensely. “Not yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the rider was nearly opposite those hidden
in the brush. Roy looked at Teddy and
Nick, then nodded. Carelessly the five men
walked their horses into the middle of the
trail, adequately covering it. The slouched
horseman yelled, pulled back sharply on the
reins, and brought his pony to a sudden, sliding
halt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You crazy fools!” he shouted. “Want to
send me over the cliff? What in time’s the
matter with you-all, jumpin’ out on me like
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, mister, we weren’t aimin’ to do
just that,” Gus drawled mildly. “But we
heard you comin’, an’ we kind o’ thought you
might like to palaver a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t!” The man turned angrily
toward Gus. “An’ I’ll thank you to move
aside an’ let me by! I’m in a hurry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shorely you can’t be in a hurry on a nice
evenin’ like this!” Nick suggested gently.
“Seems like yuh ought to be ridin’ along slow
like, observin’ the birds an’ the flowers, an’
maybe tossin’ sticks with paper tied to ’em
down into the gully. Hey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand aside, you locoed cow-nurse! I ain’t
got no time fer no foolishness! Once more,
I’m tellin’ yuh—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy saw the man’s hand go for his gun.
Quick as a flash, the boy drew and the reckless
horseman found himself looking into the
muzzle of a blue-barreled Colt. With his hand
on his belt, the man hesitated, then gave a
sneering laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kind o’ sudden, ain’t yuh? Well, suppose
you speak up an’ tell me what this is all about.
I come along this here trail, aimin’ to make the
canyon’s end before ten to-night, when a gang
of stick-up artists shoves a six-gun down my
throat! If it’s money you want—” The man
reached in his shirt pocket and drew out some
silver, which he threw contemptuously on the
ground at Flash’s feet. “Here! That’s all
I got. Pretty poor pickin’, hey, boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty considerable of a fool, you are,”
drawled Gus contemptuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy’s eyes narrowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it easy,” he said in a voice that,
somehow, reminded Nick of a taut violin string.
“You know we’re not highwaymen. We want
to ask you some questions—<span class='it'>Reltsur</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man started, almost imperceptibly, then
recovered his composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I ain’t no encyclopedia of information,
but I’ll do the best I can,” he replied sarcastically.
“Only hurry up. It’s gettin’ late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy made a motion with his head, and Bug
Eye moved toward the rider. He reached over
and quickly yanked the man’s gun from its
holster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Playin’ safe, hey? Afraid I’ll pull on yuh
with that starin’ me in the face?” and he
nodded at the gun Teddy held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that,” Roy said sharply.
“We’ll do the asking, and you the answering.
First, where’s the rest of your gang?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gang?” The man laughed shortly.
“Don’t know what yuh mean. I ain’t got no
gang. I’m just a poor little me—all alone,”
and he laughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I suppose you don’t know where Sholo
Caves are?” Teddy asked, watching him closely
through the dusk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sholo—Sholo Caves?” This time there
was no mistaking the start. “Why—I heard
tell of ’em. Back a ways, ain’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe!” Teddy rode closer. Suddenly he
jammed the gun into the man’s ribs, causing
a grunt of pain and surprise. “Now answer
this, and answer it quick!” he snapped.
“Where are Belle Manley and her two
friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the man seemed too stunned
to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Belle—Manley?” he faltered. “I—I don’t
know what you’re talkin’ about. How should I
know? Who are they? What—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Save it!” Teddy’s voice cut the air like
a knife. “Once more—where is my sister?”
The hammer of the gun came back with an
ominous click. Wide-eyed with fright, the man
stared into the piercing eyes before him. Then
he gulped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yuh—yuh got me cold!” he whispered.
“I’m sunk! I’ll tell—I’ll tell everything!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, with a wild yell, he sank his spurs
deep into the pony’s side. The horse, frantic
with pain, leaped forward, striking Roy’s mount
head on and then swerved to the fiercely pulled
reins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get him!” Gus yelled. “Nick, bust him
wide open! Let him have it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a sound came from Teddy. Deliberately
he raised his gun. There was a roar that
echoed amid the canyon’s walls, proving its
name, and the fleeing rider crumpled in the
saddle. The next moment he slid to the ground,
and the horse, free of its burden, dashed along
the trail, to disappear around the bend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy quickly dismounted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hated to do it, but I had to,” he said
sadly. “You boys know I had to. I hope
I didn’t—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent over the form on the ground. As
he touched the man’s arm a savage cry arose,
and the figure came to life with a suddenness
that sent Teddy staggering back, a dark stain
on the boy’s face showing where the closed fist
had struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s all right,” Teddy said shortly, wiping
the blood from his cheek. “Sit up, you! Another
break and I’ll shoot off your head instead
of your arm! Sit up now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muttering under his breath, the man obeyed.
He swayed where he sat, cuddling his arm, a
look of anguish on his face. But the boys were
in no mood for sympathy. There was other
business on hand—business that must be transacted
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to answer the question?” Roy demanded,
leaning over his horse and gazing at
the form on the path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What question?” the man groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are those girls you brought from the
8 X 8?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell yuh I—” The grim Colt menaced
his head, and the man shrank back. “Gimme
time! I’m tryin’ to tell yuh, ain’t I! They’re
in—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys listened eagerly, their hearts
thumping madly. They leaned forward, Teddy
kneeling on the ground, his eyes boring into
those of the wounded man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re—in—Sholo Caves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with a sigh, the outlaw toppled over,
his head hitting the ground with a thud, and he
lay still.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIII</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>On to the Rescue</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Fainted,” Bug Eye remarked, and leaped
from his horse. Pulling his canteen from his
saddle, he doused the man’s face with the water
in it, desisting at the first sign of returning
consciousness. Replacing the top on the canteen,
Bug Eye flung it down beside the silent
figure and remounted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You-all heard what he said?” Nick asked
excitedly. “Ike Natick was right! Sholo
Caves! Come on, boys! Let that snake lie.
He’ll be all right with the water. We’ll get him
later. He’s too badly shot up to move an’
his horse is gone. Yow! We’re off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the news that they were on the right
trail, came bounding hope and a joy that expressed
itself in vigorous denunciation of
Reltsur and his gang. With scarcely a backward
glance, the five rode swiftly up the trail
toward the falls that roared in the distance.
They were not callous, but something more important
than wounded outlaws sent them rushing
forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we can only find dad!” Teddy yelled, as
he guided Flash with a sure hand. “This blame
darkness! We shan’t be able to see a thing in
a few minutes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t help it,” Roy answered. “If we
don’t meet dad, we’ll go on ourselves. Guess
we can handle any bunch of kidnappers that
rides. How about it, boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said a mouthful!” Gus roared. “Let
’em come shootin’! The more the merrier!
We’ll smoke ’em out, if we have to! No—guess
we can’t do that, on account of the girls.
But we’ll sure send some hot lead buzzin’
’round their ears!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The full darkness of the canyon night came
upon them as they rode, and, of necessity, they
had to dismount and lead the ponies. Teddy
fretted at the delay, but it was unavoidable,
and they hurried as fast as was compatible
with safety—and perhaps a little faster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They soon reached Gravestone Falls, and all
knew that the other side of the canyon was not
two hundred yards across. To reach the caves,
they had to turn sharply to the right and double
back slightly on their trail. Had they known
it, they could have come a much shorter way,
as had the girls and their guard, who did not
ride near the falls. But since they had arranged
to meet Mr. Manley here, it was necessary
that they take the longer route, even had
they known of the shorter. At this point the
canyon curved, the walls coming closer together,
until, a short distance below the caves,
they met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The falls proper were not a part of the
canyon itself, but, nevertheless, being near it,
they fed the stream at its bottom. The roaring,
while not tremendous, was loud enough to
prevent any one on the other side of the canyon
from hearing a call, however loud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy waited until the others were around
him, then declared:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon we shan’t find dad to-night! He
may be across there, and he may not. Shouting
won’t do a bit of good. And we can’t shoot—the
rustlers might hear us and take alarm.
Boys, it’s up to us. Do we go on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do!” Roy exclaimed. “And not in the
dark, either! Look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed to the sky. Over the rim of the
mountain a dull red crescent arose—the first of
the full moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the orb turned gradually from ruby to
silver white, flooding the canyon with its glow,
the five looked to their firearms. Then they
slowly made their way along the rocky path.
They had remounted again, knowing the ponies
could see their way by the light of the moon,
and, as they rounded the curve, following the
gorge, the noise of the falls increased, then
faded to a sullen murmur. They had left the
meeting place behind, and with grim resolves
to prove the caves could be taken by five determined
men, all riding together, they urged
their horses forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They remembered what Pop Burns had told
them—that the caves were practically inaccessible
unless attacked from both sides of the
canyon at once. Yet this did not deter them.
Their hearts high with hope, they felt capable
of conquering any stronghold, no matter how
well fortified. The girls were there—not half
an hour’s ride away! Could they stop now,
with success almost in their grasp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Either we bring Belle out of here or we
stay in ourselves,” Roy whispered, as though
to himself. But Teddy heard him, and nodded
silently. They would fight—they would die—but
they would not be beaten back!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost there,” Nick said in a low voice.
“Let’s stick together, boys. We can’t afford
to get separated. Roy, suppose you take
charge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right. Now let’s see. Who knows anything
about the layout of those caves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know they set pretty near the edge of the
gully, Roy,” Nick answered, in a doubtful voice.
“An’ I think you can come at them from either
end. But <span class='it'>we</span> can’t, ’cause the only way to get
to the other side from where we are, is past
them. So we’ll have to depend on surprising
that gang of rustlers before they know what’s
up. Once they discover us, we’ll have to move
fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy thought for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we only had a few more men! But we
haven’t, so what’s the use of wishing? Teddy,
some one suggested, a way back, that we send
a man on ahead to investigate. What do you
think about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much, Roy. If you want me to, I’ll
do it; but I can’t see that we’d gain much.
They’ve got a guard out—maybe two. I’m
pretty sure of that. What we ought to do is
to get up on them as quietly as we can, knock
the guard off cold, if we have to, then depend
on our guns for the rest.” As he spoke the
boy’s eyes flashed and he breathed faster.
When the time for action came he would be
ready to do his part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds good to me,” Gus drawled. “Roy,
when we start, we got to shoot as we go. I
heard the bunch has two New York gunmen
along. Well, we’ll see how they like a taste of
Western methods,” and he smiled grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it’s settled?” Roy asked, looking
from one to the other. “We ride on together.
When we get near, we slide off the broncs and
nab the lookout, if there is one. Then—what’s
in our way we take out! I don’t know
how many men they’ve got, but unless it’s an
army we’ll go through ’em. All set, boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All set!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The answer came in tense whispers from men
who were ready to face death—and expected
to. Guns were loosened in holsters. Belts
were tightened. Rifles were moved toward the
rear of saddles to allow a quick descent from
the pony. Long-barreled guns were useless in
a hand to hand fight, and the boys put their
faith in their automatic pistols.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they started on this last leg of their
journey toward an end none could foretell, each
rider felt a great relief surge through him.
The time had come. Ahead of them lay Sholo
Caves, and within them the three girls were
captives. They must be rescued. If some of
the boys lost their lives—well, at least they
could take some in payment. No matter what
happened, they would go on to the end. Their
task lay before them.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIV</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Out of Bondage</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>Long, grey shadows flattened themselves
against the walls of the canyon—moving shadows—five
of them. The moonlight, except
where it was cut off by the figures on horseback,
flooded the rocky gorge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men were almost as silent as these silhouettes
while they rode forward. The ponies,
sensing the tenseness in the air, restrained
their tendency to whinny at the ghostly trees
along the sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a short ride, Roy, who was leading, slid
noiselessly from his bronco and waited on foot
for the others, who, when they saw the boy dismount,
did likewise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d better picket the ponies here,” Roy
whispered. “The ledge is plenty broad, and
we may not find another place like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without comment, the men obeyed. Then,
slowly and cautiously, they crept forward, Roy
and Teddy going first, followed by Nick, Gus,
and Bug Eye. Suddenly a man’s voice cut the
silence. It came from behind a rock, not five
feet from the ranchers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Makin’ us lose our beauty sleep like this,”
the voice grumbled. “An’ for what? Just
’cause that fool took it into his head to get the
note to old man Manley to-night! As if to-morrow
wouldn’t do as well!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea, an’ we got to stand guard over a
passel o’ senseless gals!” growled another.
“Crazy, I calls it—plumb crazy! Why, the
way old Reltsur, as he calls himself—wonder
what his real name is?—the way he started
with that note fer the X Bar X you’d think
he was goin’ to a fire! Lickety-cut, down the
trail like a locoed steer. An’ sometimes I think
he is locoed, too—takin’ to kidnappin’ girls!
Why, blame it all, they’re more trouble than
they’re worth. Me, I told him that! But no,
he would have his way. Fer revenge, he said.
Huh! Revenge! What’s he want revenge fer?
Couple of hundred head of white-face Durhams
’ud be more to my notion. Got a match, Bill?
This pipe’s gone out. Guess she don’t draw
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around the corner of the rock came the reflection
of a tiny flame, and Teddy nudged Roy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jump ’em?” he breathed. It was a tense
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy shook his head. “Not yet. We may
hear something that’ll help us. Listen—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one who spoke first continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a funny bird, that Reltsur. Now
where’d he pick up a name like that? Sounds
like a Russian dressing. You know, before we
got mixed up with that X Bar X outfit he was
O. K. Just a regular rustler then, an’ he knew
his stuff, let me tell yuh. Almost as good as
that other waddy we had, who got knifed by
Froud. What was his name, now? Well, don’t
matter. As I was sayin’, this Reltsur was all
right up to then. When we got nabbed at the
fence he tried to slide out from under, but he
gits his right under the left ear. Ever notice
how funny he rides—leanin’ to the left, kind
of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea, but he don’t ride on his ear, does he?”
the other chuckled. “Anyway, we got to give
him credit fer arrangin’ that little affair at
Hawley. He sure turned that out proper. But
what ’ud he want to go an’ cart along those
billies from New York fer? They ain’t no
good. They can’t even shoot, though they said
they could. Know where they are now? Back
in town, playin’ poker with the rest of our
outfit. That’s where we ought to be, ’stead of
standin’ here catchin’ cold! What say we
duck? Hey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy seized Roy’s arm. These two must be
alone! What a chance! But now the other
spoke again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better not, Bill. Reltsur will be back soon,
an’ if we’re not here, he’ll raise Jim Henry.
But if you can keep that loose tongue of yors
still fer a while, I’m goin’ to sleep. G’night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys heard a body move restlessly about,
as though trying to find a comfortable spot for
repose. Roy glanced back. At his elbow Bug
Eye crouched, gun out and raised. Close to
him stood Gus and Nick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teddy!” Roy whispered. “Get along side
of me—like this. When I yell, we both jump
together. You fellows follow. Ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no need to answer. Roy saw his
brother’s face twitching eagerly, saw the shoulders
hunched, the neck craned forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye-o-o-w!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get ’em, boys! Knock’ em cold, if you
have to, but get ’em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a fierce, sudden rush! Yells!
Shouts!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey! what in thunder’s this? Hey, you,
take that gun outen my mouth!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They got us, Bill! Ouch, that’s my nose!
All right! You win! Only let up, fer Pete’s
sake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short, desperate scuffle followed. The dull
thud of a few blows, and Bill and his companion
were sitting stupidly on the ground,
stripped of their guns, the moon shining on
two very much astounded cattle-rustlers who
shook their heads in a dazed manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we had knowd you was goin’ to roughhouse,”
Bill began in an aggrieved tone, “Sam
an’ me would’ve—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nick—” Roy spoke sharply—“you stay
here and watch these men! If they give you
any trouble, shoot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With pleasure!” Nick responded, grinning.
“But at present they seem to be perfectly comfortable.
Hey, gents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one called Sam looked up dubiously.
“Well, I got a pack of cards an’ if yore so
inclined, we might—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither Teddy nor Roy heard the rest, for
they, followed by Gus and Bug Eye, were running
along the trail. Ahead of them they made
out a dark splotch against the stone walls. As
they came closer they saw that it was an entrance
to a cavern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Caves!” Teddy yelled, careless of
consequences. “Belle! Ethel! Are you
there? Belle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teddy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A figure ran from the opening of the cavern
and toward him. The next moment it had
cast itself into his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Teddy! Roy! We thought you’d
never come! Three days we were kept in
there! Three days!” Belle was sobbing
openly now, catching at Roy and Teddy by
turns and kissing them. But in a moment she
regained something of her composure, and
called:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nell! Ethel! Come out! It’s all right!
The boys are here! They’ve found us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then on that moonlit ledge was one of the
strangest and happiest scenes in which the boys
had ever taken part. Bug Eye cheered and
Gus chuckled in that inimitable way of his,
while the rest took turns congratulating each
other. Especially did Nell and Ethel pay outrageous
tribute to Roy and Teddy, insisting
that they were:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, so much better than those old knights
who rescued ladies from dungeons! And would
they consent to sign their names in this little
book, please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of all this merriment and hilarity,
Clovita came to the doorway of the cave,
wearing a wide grin. She did not seem at all
disturbed at the turn affairs had taken. When
the boys saw her they started back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old woman we saw at the cabin! How
did she get here? Why, we left her on the
trail hours ago. She even talked to us!
How—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She my sister—we twins,” Clovita declared,
grinning wider than ever. “You meet
her, yes? She not so nice, maybe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell a maverick she wasn’t!” Roy exclaimed.
“But never mind that now. You
girls—you’re all right? They gave you plenty
to eat and drink?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re fine,” Ethel laughed happily. “But
won’t it feel great to be home again! The
first thing I’m going to do is—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was interrupted by a yell, coming from
the place they had captured the guards. Roy
reached for his gun. Then he let out a roar
of laughter as Nick called out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, Roy, these two geezers won all my
money playin’ seven-up! Come down here
quick, or they’ll have my shirt! An’ bring a
new pack of cards! These are marked, or I’m
a ring-tailed dodo-bird!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXV</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>The Morning Joy</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“What a night <span class='it'>that</span> was!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy, turning on his pillow, observed his
brother. The early afternoon sun was streaming
through the windows of their bedroom at
the ranch house of the X Bar X. From the yard
came sounds of a missing motor, interrupted
by:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now yore hittin’ along, you ole puddle
jumper. Hear that engine, Nick? Sweet,
ain’t she, since I put that new carburetor on?
Baby, this here lead mule—Stall on me, will
yuh! Consarn yore brake-bands, I’ll blow yore
piston rings clear to—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bug Eye,” Teddy said, grinning. “He’s
got his flivver out there. Reckon some one
drove it over for him.” The boy yawned, and
stretched high.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy observed the ceiling complacently. He
seemed perfectly content to lie there, and think—think
of the many things that had happened
not twenty hours ago. Last night they were in
Thunder Canyon, at Sholo Caves. Now they
were at home, in their own room, listening to
Bug Eye’s “Address to a Flivver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lazily, Roy recalled that ride out of the
canyon with the three girls and the two prisoners
on horses they had found picketed near
the cave. Clovita had gone with them, and
it was lucky she had, for she showed them a
short cut to the other side of the canyon, where
they had met Mr. Manley and his party. His
joy at having Belle back safe and sound was
tremendous, as well it might be, and on that
long ride home his corncob pipe was never unlit
for a second. His humor kept the party in
constant gales of laughter, not even excepting
the two captured rustlers, who seemed a bit
relieved that the whole business was over.
Nick promised to visit them in jail and try to
win some of his money back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had found Reltsur where they had left
him, leaning against a tree, muttering to himself.
The wound Teddy had inflicted was
severe, but not fatal, and Mr. Manley, at all
times considerate, even to an enemy, insisted
that he take his bronco, while he rode double
with Teddy. Gus shook his head at this display
of “misplaced sympathy,” but, nevertheless,
his admiration for his boss increased tenfold.
In his own words, as he later described it to
Rad Snell, “Mr. Manley is sure one white
guy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On their way out of the canyon they had
passed the hut of the old woman, Clovita’s
sister. Here Clovita left them, Mr. Manley
feeling that it would do no good to detain her.
After all, she was but a tool in the hands of
the outlaws. The last the boys saw of her
she was beating on the door of the cabin with
her bare fist, while within all was dark. Roy
wondered vaguely if her sister had finally admitted
her or whether she had to climb in a
window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The homecoming of the girls had been momentous.
Mrs. Manley was waiting up, and
with tears of joy in her eyes she embraced her
daughter, and also Nell and Ethel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you’d come to-night!” she exclaimed.
“I just knew it! Belle, I prayed so
hard for you all that you couldn’t help being
safe! And now I have a suggestion. Mrs.
Moore and Norine want to make some tea and
toast. What about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yell that had gone up was answer
enough. And after the rustlers had been put
in the bunk-house, with Sing Lung guarding
them with a huge knife and a ferocious frown
on his face that would have deceived any one
who did not know him, the rescue party sat
down to a late midnight supper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Manley had bound Reltsur’s arm up and
quartered him with his companions, with Sing
Lung as guard. As Roy, in bed, thought about
this man a puzzled look came over his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Teddy,” he remarked, sitting up and
gazing out the window at Bug Eye and his precious
flivver, “that’s a funny name for any one
to have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” Teddy opened his eyes stupidly.
“You talkin’ to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say Reltsur is a mighty queer name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence, unbroken save for the slow breathing
of the boys. Then,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got it!” Teddy yelled suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what Reltsur means! Jimminy, I
just thought of it! Came to me like a flash. I
was always quick like that. Fast on my feet,
too. I remember one time—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for the love of Pete, spill it! What
does Reltsur mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy gazed at his brother, a grin on his
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spell it backwards!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spell it—” Roy stopped and looked
thoughtful. “Let’s see. R-u-s-t-l-e-r. Rustler!
By jinks, Teddy, you’re right! Rustler!
Who’d have thought it? The crazy guy. Using
a thing like that for a name! Golly, he must
be cookoo. Must think he’s a villain out of the
middle ages. In those days a man would take
for his name anything that—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say!” Teddy interrupted, laughing.
“Well, that’s what Reltsur means, all
right. Let’s get up and tell dad. Baby, that
was some sleep! We got in about twelve,
didn’t we? From twelve until—let’s see, one-thirty.
Wow! I’m hungry! Let’s go down
and see Ethel and Nell, and then we eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the boys descended the stairs, Teddy
thought with a smile that but a few hours ago
they weren’t sure whether they would ever see
the old ranch again. They had expected a fierce
fight, and were ready for it. They knew those
rustlers could shoot, and Teddy and Roy had
resigned themselves to whatever might occur.
Yet they had met no one but an old woman and
two punchers who played cards with Nick
Looker! Teddy laughed aloud as he recalled
Nick’s plaintive cry from the trail of Thunder
Canyon:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, Roy, these two geezers won all my
money playin’ seven-up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside, in the yard, Bug Eye was surrounded
by a crowd to whom he was explaining
the mysteries of his new carburetor. Belle and
Ethel were standing arm in arm, and Mr. Manley
was chuckling gleefully at Bug Eye’s attempt
to show that a four-cylinder motor ran
better when two of the cylinders refused to
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s supposed to do that!” he was insisting.
“That’s what this here doohickey is for—to
con-serve gas! You see, yay, look who
comes! Boys, you’re just in time! Make way!
Make way, you vassels—or something like
that. What’s the good word, boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, and I’ll give you the low-down,”
Roy laughed. “Dad, Teddy made a discovery—a
stu-pen-dous discovery. He found out
what Reltsur means!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did, son? What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spell it backwards and you’ll soon see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment there was silence. Nick’s
head bobbed up and down, his tongue on his
lower lip as he figured it to himself. Gus and
Bug Eye struggled manfully, but had to wait
until Mr. Manley shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rustler! That’s it, sure as shootin’!
Teddy, you’re a genius! It’s rustler turned
around!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always thought that bozo was a little
balmy,” Pop Burns declared, when the matter
was explained to him. “Now I know it!
Snakes, it’s a wonder he doesn’t walk backwards!
Huh! Rustler, hey? Guess he’s had
enough action for a while, anyhow. He can
think up new names fer himself while he’s
sittin’ in jail—an’ if you take my advice, that
won’t be at Hawley, boss!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a laugh, Mr. Manley agreed. Then he
glanced fondly at his two sons, who had, together
with their friends, brought this Reltsur
to justice and had rescued Belle and the
others from his clutches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the ranch boys were to have other happenings,
and the further adventures of Roy and
Teddy will be told in the next volume, to be
called: “The X Bar X Boys on Whirlpool
River.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy, leaning forward, whispered to Ethel.
She nudged Belle and Nell, and, casually, the
three girls walked away from the little group
surrounding Bug Eye, who had continued his
demonstration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments the boys followed and met
the girls near the corral. It was the work of
but a few moments to saddle Flash and Star
and three other ponies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Softly they rode out of the yard. If any one
saw them, they gave no sign. Once behind the
corral Teddy leaped Flash forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go!” he yelled. “To that stump out
there! See it? Come on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the prairie the riders swept. And as
they left the ranch houses, there came to them
a faint, far-off voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now this carburetor, she works on a funny
system. First the gas condenses in here, ya
see, an’ the air is let in by this here doofunny——”</p>
